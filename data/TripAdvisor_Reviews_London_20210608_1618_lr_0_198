When we arrived we were taken to our room via a goods lift, which was fine, we were happy with our room, though thought it odd that there was a sign saying there had been no hot water all that day.  We went out and upon returning I opened the door and realised our room was flooded - the water pipes had burst. Management were not helpful and my friend who was staying in another room helped rescue what could be rescued of our stuff which was drenched - water was pouring out over the toilet and from the walls.  We asked for something in writing stating what had happened and were refused. After waiting in reception for a while to be moved we were told to go with a taxi…",Date of stay: December 2009,1.0

The Receptionist at check in was completely disinterested verging on rude. The room stank of stale smoke. Usually I'd reqest another room, but I assumed they'd all be as bad. The bathroom was at least clean and newly refurbished. The toilet cistern however made an extremely startling noise whenever the toilet was used and the drians stank. The bed was ridiculously uncomfortable but at least the sheets seemed freshly laundered.   Breakfast was a standard affair, but service was non-existant. When tea was finally forthcoming, I had to help myself to tecups from behind the bar.   I don't think I'd stay again or recommend this place.

It took us one hour walking.Whoever said ten minutes must have used a helicopter. I had seen the mixed reviews and thought I'd give it a chance.   The staircase and the floors are running at a slant and the carpet is lifting in places. At the top of the stairs the carpet is stuck down with tape and is very dangerous. If health and safety checked this hotel they would probably close it down.   The hotel have tried to refresh the look of the place with white paint and have covered the carpet.Check out my photos.

However more recently we stayed in the hotel for a weekend and we did not enjoy the experience. Firstly we stayed in room 207 which was awful as there was a small gap between the single glazed window pane and frame meaning that noise from the busy road outside was not insulated, resulting in no sleep that night whatsoever. We asked to move rooms, but the one of the staff said she had to consult her manager first and let us know later in the day and we were made to felt like we were incoveniencing her. Also no apologies for our bad experience. We eventually got moved to room 203 which was slightly better as we were facing the street just off the main road,…",Date of stay: February 2009,3.0

Room not cleaned properly, not at all one day.   The piece of cellophane on the carpet (sweet paper?) we regarded as a friend - it was there when we arrived, and still there when we left.

And this hotel is no exception, it is basic in the extreme.  The hotel isn't dirty, and the location is not too out of the way, but the ambience is fairly prison cell-esque. The walls are thin, and I had a sink in my room which made a bizarre glugging noise most nights. The rooms are bare and without even token decoration, and the shared bathrooms are pretty drab.  If you've never stayed in London, it is worth paying as much as you can possibly afford so that your hotel doesn't ruin your holiday.
