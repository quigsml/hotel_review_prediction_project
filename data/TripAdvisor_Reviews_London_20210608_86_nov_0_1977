The family room was adequate, a little small. It is located really close to the train station but with the window closed the noise isn’t too bad. The room didn’t have AC, just a ventilation system, which meant it did get a bit warm (but we were there for a mini heatwave).  The swimming pool is quite small but nice addition. Be aware that with current covid restrictions you have to book a slot.  The breakfast was fine, standard hotel choice. The restaurant does a decent value kids menu, and adult food was nice. However service in the restaurant was very slow.",Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

The rooms are very business like, nothing really to write about but clean nevertheless. We had been upgraded to an executive room, but it was far from large, however I understand most hotels In London have quite small rooms compared to other Cities. Due to Covid, I had the whole swimming pool and gym to myself, which was good, as you book an hour time slot per household. The location was a short walk to Paddington station, and it’s located in a lovely area where you can stroll down by the canal through little Venice. Breakfast was made to order, and was quite substantial. This is a huge plus when certain hotel brands in Covid times fail to give you anything but breakfast in a bag.  To summarise, it was nothing special, but wouldn’t deter anyone from staying here.   …",Date of stay: November 2020,4.0

One even made a list of her favorite places to go in her hometown of Barcelona when she learned we were heading there next.   What we didn't love: The toilet is separated in a different room from the shower/sink room. So strange to think you have nowhere to wash your hands immediately after using the toilet. Also, the shower room has opaque white doors and is right next to where the beds are located. Therefore, the whole room gets bright if one turns on the light in that room in the middle of the night.

Also, on a couple of occasions the fresh kept towels by the room service guys was stinking. So we had to call them to get it replaced. Another thing that I didn’t like is that they have the same menu for breakfast everyday. Although they do make eggs the way you want. This is mainly in the Paddington office area, so people visiting UK for tourism should ideally stay somewhere in central London as this is a little bit far off. Also the tube station is about 15 min walk for most of the lines. ",Date of stay: November 2018,4.0

Overall a great hotel, rooms clean and warm.  Girls at reception were fantastic and arranged a little cake in the room for our son's 18th.  The pool and gym are very nice too but unfortunately very cold on the last day.  Breakfast was great they had absolutely everything you could ask for, the down side was that the staff were not very friendly and looked like they didn't want to be there, and had the plate snapped from under you before you were even finished. The bar staff could also do with a motivational talk.  The hotel is a little tricky to get to and we had to access it through Paddington station.

The Executive Room was excellent - nice touch having a Bose docking bay and USB charger sockets. Breakfast also fantastic - everything you'd expect from a big hotel.  One drawback - and I have NO IDEA how a brand new hotel could make this oversight - is that there were no power sockets next to the bed, or anywhere near. Phones had to be left on the other side of the room. This isn't enough to be a major grumble, it just baffles me that when designing a brand new hotel, you wouldn't put power outlets next to or even near the bedside tables.",Date of stay: April 2015,5.0

It was okay, but the room was really average and small, and I think the hotel needs some renovation. First of all, it's not so close to the train station, there are much more hotels in the area that are really close, so if we need the hotel near Paddington again we'll prefer to stay in another one. Second, when I was taking a shower I found out that my towel was dirty. It had little stains and it was really disgusting. I was all wet and obviously couldn't ask for another one.

The previous night I had stayed in the novotel Cardiff and that had been more than acceptable but the paddington hotel left me disappointed. The room we were given had stained carpets, drawer fronts falling off and the bedding was bobbely and grey.
