My boyfriend and I are backpacking and always look for the best deals. At this hostel you pay a low price but it is not a good deal if you get bit by bed bugs and have to sleep in the hangout room on the sofa scratching your bites all night long.  My advice would be to simply stay somewhere else. And their ´breakfast´' is pretty terrible.
