I couldn't travel to London due to travel restrictions which emerged as the effect of Corona Virus epidemic. I wanted to cancel the booking during this time and book again with new dates in July. I called and spoke to the hotel who asked me to send an email which i did. The reply was that hotel will charge me full amount no matter what. I was more than happy to pay the difference for the new dates however they are not interested in future business i suppose. To the management of the hotel to know my flights, train and other hotel booking that i had all of them reimbursed my money 100% as it was not in my control. They understood and showed empathy and i did appreciate their gesture and made multiple future bookings with them for July. Overall i feel i am not heard and had to share this somewhere as the telephone and email did not help me.…",Date of stay: March 2020,1.0

Dishonest and fraudulent, we booked a room 2 months ago through Booking.com and only three days before departure, we were informed of the cancellation of the reservation due to problems with the credit card. We called the hotel directly for clarification and they were absolutely not interested in solving the problem, even though we had more than one credit card available: our room was no longer available!!! It is clear that this is a fraud, and that the structure has probably canceled our 4 night reservation (made two months ago !!) in favor of other reservations for a greater number of nights or at a higher price. This is a sign of misconduct in tourism and hotel management, of poor customer and tourism consideration.  We will never forget this bad experience, and will do what in our possibility to discourage this behaviour even with our legal forces.

The hotel rooms are kept clean and tidy and the staff are always helpful. As the breakfast room is very small we use the nearby Paul Rhodes Bakery as our daily starting point - or if you prefer english breakfast Cafe Diana just around the corner from the hotel.

Nothing was advertised incorrectly, but we were surprised by the amount we paid for what we got, compared with similar accommodation in other big European cities like Paris and Rome. Here are a few things to note before booking: Our room had “2 double beds and 1 single bed”, so potentially for 5 people. It was tiny: approx 16m2. The “double beds” were 120 cm wide. (A standard double bed is 180 cm wide. ) We were in room 6 on the ground floor. The window opens straight onto the street, so we had to close it at night.

Had room 15. Hotel is nice, bedrooms were very clean. You literally are 5mins walk away from Regents and Hyde Park where Kensington Palace is located. Ony a few negatives on the hotel that is that they do not have a safety deposit box in the bedrooms or behind reception for holding your money and passport. The breakfast room is absolutely tiny and its in reception. There is about 5 tables, breakfast runs from 7.30-9.30am.....best advice is to go down around 8.30 as you wont be able to get a seat after this. Didn't spend too much time in the hotel as was out all day. But I would recommend it as its cheap, its not the Ritz but it is good all the same. Also it has no restaurant, so its not really a hotel in that…",Date of stay: September 2009,3.0

Really nice, quite hotel, unluckily at the last floor without lift, but it was worth it. Clean, quite, we were lucky: we got a 4 persons room for 2, so the room was big enough... but the guy at the reception said we were lucky as the rooms for 2 are small...  The bathroom was completly new, there was a flat TV in the room, a kettle and so. Nothing to say, really nice, some restaurants around, a Tesco at 5 min walk, as far as a metro station.  I highly recommend it !!",Date of stay: February 2009,5.0

Location is perfect. With Notting Hill tube station only 2 min. from the hotel most attractions in London can be reached in 15-20 minutes. The room we got (Room 21 on the top floor) was very small and could just about fit the bed. But as we only needed to sleep there it didn't matter much.  The only problem with the room was that there was no lock on the window. It could be opend form the outside and there was access from the roof. We pointet this out a number of times at the reception but they didn't fix it.  The hotel can't be recomended for people who has problems with walking on stairs, as most of the rooms requires a lot of stair climbing.

I had originally booked a single room for a 5-night stay, but a friend decided to join me in London at the last minute. Upon arrival at the hotel, the receptionist wasn't too pleased about this and wondered how on earth we'd stay in a single room for the first night. He was then very helpful and managed to accomodate us in a double room for the remainder of our stay. The rate he gave us was lower than the double room rate, he said.  Upon arriving at the single room (room number 13!), we understood why he was wondering: the room had the size of a walk-in closet, with barely any room to open or store a suitcase, but at least it had a shower (shared…",Date of stay: May 2009,4.0

I think for the price we paid, we had a good deal. Did not expect anything close to this since the previous hotel we stayed in Paddington wasnt up to mark.
