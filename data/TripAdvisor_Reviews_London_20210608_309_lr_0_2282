The current early year price is excellent value for money, but three small shortcomings made this a much less pleasurable visit. The small desk in the room (needed for work on this visit) is half taken up by a coffee machine which is wired into the wall, so can’t be moved out of the way. The restaurant stops serving at 10pm (fair enough) but the bar doesn’t stock anything at all to nibble with a drink - no crisps, peanuts, nothing. The check-in staff were v welcoming but later in the evening the staff seemed tired and tetchy. Come on Ambassadors! It wouldn’t take much to get back to top form. ",Date of stay: January 2018,3.0

Don't usually expect much from hotels so close to major train stations (Euston), but the Ambassadors surpassed expectations. Rooms are very modern, but reasonably spacious and well equipped. The expresso machine was a welcome treat, and hotels that don't charge for WiFi are to be applauded. Breakfast was very good and nice to have the choice of both a buffet and freshly cooked food.

It was a very pleasant experience with good food and service.

We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast on both occasions, which is on the right as soon as you walk into the hotel, and it was a very pleasurable experience.

I generally find London hotels outrageously expensive and poor quality unless you pay loads, and this one epitomises this idea. On the surface it is a nice idea. Good location near Euston, modern funky decor. A ""wet room"" instead of a traditional bathroom. However, in practice the ""wet room"" is just a room that gets wet. In other words, the entire bathroom floor gets flooded meaning that any subsequent trips to the bathroom after a shower result in wet feet. It also means (or at least this was the case in my room) that the whole room, including the bedroom, smelt kind of damp and musty. It was really quite bad!

This can be disconcerting because you have already paid for your room in full and what happens if you don't have the right amount of funds on your card at that moment?

It was certainly very good for one person in a double compact room.  The hotel is very convenient for Euston station and within easy walking distance of King's Cross and St Pancras.

Dinner was included in the deal and was of excellent quality. A buffet style breakfast was also included and had everything you could want. All the staff were very friendly and heplful.  The hotel is across the road from Euston Station meaning it is within walking distance of many attractions.

Our room was clean enough although we did face the street and the noise was bad.. traffice noise, the disco at the hotel opposite and the church bells to name a few meant an almost sleepless night. The bathroom did leave a lot to be desired, the towels where clean although a couple had holes in them but all in all the bathroom really could have done with a refit years ago. The room itself apart from a couple of stains on the carpet and a little paint flaking off the skirting boards was not too bad. Although for £150 a night I would have expected a LOT better. The breakfast was good and the service of the staff was also fine although all of the staff are foreign and this was a…",Date of stay: December 2004,3.0

The receptionist was nice and friendly, and the place looked bright and clean. The room was a big disappointment though. Dull, cold and badly in need of refurbishment. My room overlooked the street and the noise was horrendous. All night. The bathroom was grotty too, paint peeling from the walls and a decrepit shower (but a nice deep bath and plenty of hot water). You have to leave a deposit if you want to use the room telephone or charge anything to your room. Breakfast was okay. In this day of economy hotels like Travelodge, you can do much better than this place for your money. ",None,2.0

This is by far the worst hotel I have ever had the mis-fortune to stay in!    The previous reviews on this hotel are absolutely true.  My room was small and grim with a musty smell.  The window didn't close properly and consequently I was subjected to the noise of the traffic below all night.    The worst feature by far however, was the bathroom.  It was apallingly small - probably the same size as you would expect to find in a caravan.  I couldn't even describe it as a 'room'.  It had a 'cabin' feel to it  - you stepped up into it and the whole thing was made of cheap blue fibreglass.  The sink was tiny and the overhead shelf protruded so far it was impossible to wash.  There was no bath (you'd never fit one in!) and no shower cubicle as…",None,1.0

It looked a decent hotel upon arriving.  However, the clean good carpet finishes at level 1, and turns into a shabby old thing.  We asked for a non smoking room, but were given smoking, to be fair they did change the room.  Two tiny single beds, a bathroom (but you really cannot call it that) it had a door on it like a fridge door!, inside it was worse than a shower room you would find in a caravan with the shower hose connecting from the hand basin.  The rooms did not look anything like the pictures shown on the internet.  The staff we found to be polite and helpful however, I would not recommend this hotel I have stayed in better B&B.

If I could give it 0/5, I would.  I stayed here on my own, and found my horrible, poky little room - a double - so claustrophobic that I don't know how two people would manage.  One of the walls was very badly affected by damp, and the moulding wallpaper was peeling off.  The bathroom was tiny and the shower was just horrible, with a manky old shower curtain that allowed water to flood all over the floor.  I arrived late at night so I had dinner in the hotel... bland and grossly overpriced.  Breakfast was average continental fare.  Staff were rude and dismissive, and had no interest in moving me to another room, so I packed up and left to find another hotel.  Never again. ",Date of stay: February 2001,1.0

Overall I thought this hotel was very bad value, especially for those who come from countries where the currency is not as strong as the pound. You deserve something better for your euros!Our room was small and uninspiring. The bed was extremely comfortable but the room was like an oven - we had to sleep with the window open - not something you would usually do in February in the UK! I woke up several times during the night feeling stiffled by the heat, and keeping the window open meant we heard the noise of the traffic passing below.Stepping in the bathroom was like going back to the eighties. It was really basic and not up to today's standards - not a place where I would want to relax after a busy day in town.The breakfast…",None,2.0

The rooms were small but reasonably decorated. The bathroom was incredibly small and old looking. The lobby is nicely decorated and they have a lounge. On the day we were departing they forgot our wakeup call and they lady at the front desk didn't really care (or speak much English). We got the room for around USD70 a night so in the end I was quite happy, though safe deposit cost GBP2 and the phone, needless to say, was expensive.",Date of stay: January 2005,2.0
