The location is perfect for both Notting Hill and Portobello explorations.  I received an amazing deal, a huge, clean, warm room with huge sash windows and an ensuite. The bed was so comfy, I overslept and missed breakfast. This didn’t matter though as the really lovely, friendly Lina, said it didn’t matter and prepared food and juice just for me. We chatted and laughed together which was lovely as I was alone.  Thank you so much for a really lovely stay. I will definitely be back.",Date of stay: October 2020,5.0

This was our first trip abroad so we came with no expectations and we were very pleased with the hotel. You can't beat the location or the quiet street. Round the corner from the Tube and bus stops on Bayswater Road, many restaurants and restaurant chains nearby. Also, 2 movie theatres down the street. One morning we slept in until 9 a.m. because it was so quiet outside even with the window open. We couldn't hear anyone else in the hotel unless we went downstairs to breakfast. The rumble of the Tube was not a problem for us. Our room was upstairs about 3 levels in the front of the hotel.  The room was equipped with a fan which helped circulate air and the…",Date of stay: June 2006,4.0

The staff was okay, not overly friendly.  I'm writing this review, however, because I feel they need a fair reply to the ""bed bug"" posting.  I freaked out about the ""bed bugs"" report on this site and called the hotel directly since I really didn't want to deal with that when we got there.  I never got to speak with the manager but the staff assured me they didn't have a problem.  Once there, I searched but thankfully found no bugs!  Our room was in the basement and, yes, the subway runs directly under but we really didn't find it that horrible and didn't bother us since we were only in the room late at night.  The room was very nicely appointed and the bathroom was one of the best we had throughout our 11…",Date of stay: April 2006,3.0

I wish we had been given a room on the upper floor and not on the ground floor because ours was noisy. First, it was next to the breakfast room, second we could ear the trains rumbling most of the night. But the staff was friendly and and the bedroom was large enough, and very clean, with a nice newly furbished bathroom, a fridge and enough room for storage. The twin beds were new and comfortable.  It is a good hotel if you are on a budget and we will probably stay there again in spite of the train traffic and the basic continental breakfast. ",None,3.0

GOOD POINTS :  We like the area very much. It is a 10-minute walk to Portobello Market, to Hyde Park or to the shops, and restaurants. There are two pubs round the corner. There are three underground lines connecting at Notting Hill station.  We found the staff very friendly and helpful.  Our bedroom was nice and clean, and well-equipped, there were a fridge and a hair-dryer but it was next to the breakfast room.

Even though the room we were given was not on the lowest level of the building, the noise and vibrations every 15 minutes (early morning to late evening) were extremely annoying. Additionally, the room was next door to the breakfast room, resulting in a clatter of cups and saucers from about 6am onwards. We asked to be moved upstairs on the second night, which reduced the noise and vibrations considerably.   Unfortunately, it appeared that some mice had set up home in this room and decided to pay me a visit when I was using the bathroom, on two separate occasions. This last incident prompted us to leave 2 days early.    On the plus side, the staff were friendly.…",None,1.0

The room turned out to be minuscule: not even enough space to put the luggage flat on the floor. The Hotel did not have a baby bed available (which would have not fit in the room anyways). The cleanliness of the room was doubtful. No elevators (and no help to carry the luggage to the second floor). No ironing board in the room, etc... One of my worst hotel experiences ever!

It has a bathroom w/ shower/bathtub in each room(a little difficult to find in London).
