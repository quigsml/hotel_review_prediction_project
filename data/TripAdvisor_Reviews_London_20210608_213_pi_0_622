It was amazing! This wasn’t the hotel I’d booked but they’d rang me and said they was shut when I looked see this one and moved here instead. From the pics it looked lovely and out of the way and it tray was! I thought london noise go hand in hand but you couldn’t hear anything in your room ours was above the tesco so on the street view but you’d never of known. Blackout curtains, 4 panel of glass meant no street sound I’m talking talking and main traffic like sirens you could but you’d hear them at home.  During this time no house keeping if your staying more than 5 days then they will switch rooms so they can clean it. If you need more tea/coffee ask at reception they give you a bag with extras in. Extra pillow ask house keeping will leave outside your door. Any rubbish leave in a bag outside your door and housekeeping will take it. You see staff, there was 1 breakfast the staff was by themselves  and rushed of their feet but the other days we had 3/4 members of staff taking orders and sorting out. Tea/coffee depends on who served you as most let you go up yourselves same as toast. I feel this was a hidden gem in the city, 5 min walk at most from London Bridge underground station or 10 min max from London Bridge station. There’s a tesco right outside a Sainsbury’s 2 min walk down the road incase you need anything. Plenty of places to eat out as well   …",Date of stay: August 2020,5.0

Fortunately the encounter wasn't too embarrassing!  Tip for breakfast: ask for a poached egg that is cooked for you and brought to your table. Choose anything else for your fry up and although under lights is always luke warm. Even the coffee machine was luke warm!

","We stayed here as a family of three 23rd-25th July 2019. Our intentions on booking were to have a base to come back and relax in during our sight seeing trip. As we arrived early for check in, we took the opportunity to relax in the sunshine and on returning at 2pm we were informed our room was ready. Rooms are fresh and modern and ours had amazing views over London. Tea, coffee etc provided, although I would have preferred to have more than 2 servings of each. As an avid coffee drinker this was not enough for me.  The breakfast was plentiful and tasty with lots of different selections to try. The seating area was quite small and cramped for the hotel and there was quite a bit of awkward squeezing past people’s chairs etc during service.
