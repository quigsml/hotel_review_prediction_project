The location is great if you want to be further from tourist crowds and surrounded with beautiful architecture of South Kensington. Hotel itself is lovely, very quiet and elegant. Food was great for breakfast, dinner or just cream tea. Staff was very helpful all the time.  Tube station is only few blocks away and it takes about 10-15 minutes to be in the center of the City. The Natural History museum is just down the street and Victoria and Albert few minutes away. We enjoyed walking to Kensington Gardens, Albert Hall or Harrods.

The service and staff were okay although many didn't seem to know what they were doing. I think they were in training but they definitely weren't ready. Every meal we had at the hotel ( 1 late lunch, 1 dinner and 2 breakfasts) the order was wrong somehow. Also, once we would give our order, about 5 minutes later someone else would come ask for our order. In a five star hotel, that shouldn't happen. The service definitely could have been much better.
