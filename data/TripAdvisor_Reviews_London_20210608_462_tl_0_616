The staff were pleasant and friendly and the reception desk and bar were always attended with no despairing long waits so typical of some places. The room was small but quite adequate for my purpose. It was well appointed, clean, and there was nothing to complain about. Breakfast was buffet style but the food was fresh and hot with quite a reasonable choice available. The bar merges with the dining room and is what I would call Café Style. The price of a pint of Stella Artois was £3.90 a steal for what it might have been in London! This was a short business trip and the hotel made the stay very pleasant. The price was reasonable and the hotel did its job.",Date of stay: May 2016,4.0

Be warned that booking a room online does NOT guarantee there will actually be a room when you turn up. Apparently, it is regular Travelodge policy to overbook hotels in the expectation that people will not turn up. Knowing I was going to be arriving late at night and as not to be left with the last room going (oh, the ironies!) I phoned in the morning and spoke to a very helpful staff member who supposedly booked me into a room (even giving me the room number). When I showed up at 11.30pm, not only was there no record of the room having been booked, but it was suggested I hadn't spoken to a receptionist but possibly a member of the kitchen staff...I was told that in fact I was lucky to be getting the last room,…",Date of stay: December 2013,3.0
