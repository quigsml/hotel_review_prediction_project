The building is a bit outdated but the atmosphere was really social and the staff were all super friendly. I spoke to the manager and he mentioned they were going through renovations and redoing all of the bathrooms so should be really nice when finished. It’s super close to lots of public transportation options so easy to get into the city. And I also quite enjoyed the area around the hostel - it’s a bit hipster and lots of cheap pubs. Would recommend for a cheap accommodation and to experience a different part of London.,Date of stay: February 2020,5.0

The worst part of our stay was the fact that we could not get ANY sleep.

We could either roast to death and leave the window closed or leave it open and listen to the heavy metal music. When the band took breaks then groups of people went outside and were talking and carrying on. They also would hang out in front of the door to the hostel which was a bit annoying.

Not used to London and found this hostel really easily once getting off at new cross gate.  Was checked in by a lovely lady and she even checked train times for me for early the next morning.  The room itself was basic but beds were comfy.  I was in a 4 person room, and the room also had a fridge.  Lots to do around the hostel, lots of bars, fast food, train stations etc.. One thing I was really disappointed in though was breakfast was meant to be served at 8 and as I had to catch a train I arrived 5 mins early so I could grab once it was set up and I could run to catch my train... But sat for almost 15 mins and there wasn't any sign do ended up leaving without it.  But otherwise can't fault the hostel!  I had a great nights sleep and would…",Date of stay: July 2012,4.0

In no other city or small town were we this uncomfortable (my hunch is that all these great reviews this place gets are from people just starting their travels). The beds! Oh my god, the beds. More box spring than bed. You could actually SEE the springs through the sheet, and you could feel each one digging into different parts of your body no matter what position you were in. Our room was also located just above the entrance to the bar, and it is LOUD. day and night and early morning. i could hear the bass through my earplugs. Between the noise and the beds, a good night's sleep was totally out of the question.   Then there's the cost. We spent more on this room than we did anywhere…",Date of stay: July 2012,1.0

You can met people from everywhere and have a good time. The room was clean and is not like other places that make you pay for everything, they offer wifi, breakfast and towels for free. A plus is that is really well connected with the city center and there are local bars around (so you can avoid turist prices)",Date of stay: February 2012,5.0

Comfortable rooms and fun atmosphere, great place for party lovers. Average cleanliness. Great views of London from the rooms at the back of the building - London Eye, Telecom Tower, St. Pauls, The Guerkin and the City of London and Canary Wharf all visible.  The hostel is located above a pub with live bands most evenings and next to a nightclub this is a good place for people who like to spend their evenings entertained. Perhaps not so good if you like to go to bed early and you haven't got any earplugs! New Cross is a very multi-cultural area with the local arts university adding an interesting edge to the mix, making for some very unique and characterful pubs in the area with lots going on.",Date of stay: May 2011,4.0

Definitely great for what you pay! The breakfast included is also standard nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about either! The linen in the room was clean and I loved that there was a sink in the room. Staff were very friendly and very eager to help you as much as they can. other guest's were also very friendly.

It was easy to get to and the staff were very helpful. Anything with free Tea and Coffee is a winner in my eyes!   The area was clearly dominated by young people with a club just below the hostel itself and, at times, it proved difficult to sleep. The rooms were clean and came with a sink in so that made it easier than having to queue for the bathroom when you wanted to brush your teeth!!  The showers did break quite regularly but there were others on other floors which we used without any problem.  On the whole, I would say this was a good place to stay. Very cheap, with friendly staff and we definitely had a great time!",Date of stay: October 2010,3.0

I got the upper bed. I tried to find a good sitting position on the bed to use my laptop (the wireless Internet was ok) but just couldn't. It was too springy. It was also a bit lumpy, but that didn't affect my sleep. It seemed like most people used their beds just for sleeping. The rest of the time, if they're in the building, they're out in the common areas: the many stairways, the common room, and right outside the building - drinking beer, smoking, sitting on the wooden benches that are close to the bar entrance, or doing all of that and watching the life on New Cross Road.   The sense of camaraderie is great. I kept a low profile in the time I was there, but more than once someone tried to talk to me.  It's not that far from the…",Date of stay: October 2010,4.0

We had the best time, me and my girlfriends!

Not a great breakfast but with everything that you need... corn-flakes, coffe, tea, milk, etc. The location is really good, in my opinion, cos you pick the train and in 5 min you are in London Bridge station.
