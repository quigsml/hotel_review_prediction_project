Called to change the date which give them their due they did but again due to COVID had to change the date again. The hotel advised they could not change the date and I would have to lose out on the room. I explained that many hotels are accommodating changes because of the constant unexpected changes however they were not bothered about this. I am a huge advocate for hotels who are supporting the public and their bookings during this time and this hotel definitely isn’t one. Would strongly advise giving business to those who are there to help customers. My advice book somewhere else! ,Date of stay: September 2020,1.0

However I feel compelled to write this review after discovering to my horror that this hotel STILL appears on lastminute website.  My experience: I was in London Dec 2019 and needed a room for the night. Premier Inns and Travelodge all full/ charging high amounts. Therefore found this place on lastminute and booked and paid online.  On arrival there were 3 people queuing ahead of me. A couple were very stressed and trying to book themselves in to Hilton Kensington whilst hotels.com also trying to book them in. The problem: Maitrise has no record of their booking. They looked exhausted and close to breaking point.  Next guy was lucky in that he had a room for the night. He told me he had waited 45 minutes to check in due to sole female receptionist dealing with other unhappy customers who were double booked.  When I got to receptionist I was advised they had no record of the booking. I showed email confirmation. I was able to use hotel phone to get through to lastminute. On hold 30 minute, spoke to a call centre abroad who hung up on me. Receptionist advised me that the hotel did not work with lastminute and that they had emailed several times to advise lastminute of this. Receptionist said she could not understand how I was able to book the room.  At the time I believed her and sympathised that it was not her fault. I still agree - it is the hotel management’s fault - but am sure she was aware of the practice of advertising on multiple websites in order to ensure every room booked for maximum profit. No concern for tired travellers needing a bed for the night - hotel only interested in maximising proctor with no concern for lone female travellers without a hotel room.  I needed to get my partner to use his credit card to find me a bed for the night. Stressful for him. Another guy turned up after me in same predicament - he ended up in Airbnb.  Summary - AVOID - this hotel has no interest in safety of customers. Still on lastminute Feb 2020.…",Date of stay: December 2019,1.0

As positives go, that is it.... On arrival we were told there was some confusion on our booking. Not a great start.  The first room (Double) we had been allocated was smaller than a standard hamster cage with a bed that was only just wider than a single.  The bathroom looked like a typical nightclubs bathroom with graffiti on the mirrors and severe lack of cleaning.  After a rather frosty argument at the desk we were told we could move room.  Upon returning from the city centre we picked our bags up and went to the new room. We were advised we had been upgraded to a room with another window.. not sure how this is an upgrade, as even prison cells have windows.   In room number 2, we were welcomed with an actual double bed however again this is where the positives end... the windows were broken, very noisy and unable to open. The bathroom shower was appalling and dirty, not seen a bottle of cleaning product since opening. Upon trying to shower, there was very little water coming out; you’d have had a better shower if they left you a watering can to fill up and stand under. You’d honestly find better facilities in a tent.  However after reading the reviews on here, not on booking.com which state it’s a 4* I’m glad there is a Starbucks over the road as the reviews are less than complimentary.  Avoid it at all costs.…",Date of stay: February 2020,1.0

Arrived at the hotel on December 6th at 11pm as booked and confirmed--to be told the hotel has been overbooked. Reason-they have ceased business with the booking agents yet the agents are still booking rooms and this is an ongoing issue. Along with 4 other couples in the lobby we were told there was no room for the night & would have to call the booking company to get a refund. We also showed them email communication from the hotel to confirm our booking to which they responded this is an automated response .  My advice - firstly don't book with this hotel however if you do decide you want to - confirm with the hotel by calling first.  Simple solution the management needs to stop overbooking and blaming the booking agents.,Date of stay: December 2019,1.0

Everything I hoped for and more.,"I am a widowed mom that was visiting her daughter who had a semester abroad.  She was staying in the Kilburn/Maida Valr area so I wanted to be close.  I was on a tight budget so when I booked this hotel at a very low price I was expecting that it might be a little rough around the edges.  I was wrong!  The room was lovely, I slept so well.  Both the bus and tube stations were within half a block.  I absolutely loved it!  Everyone who worked at the front desk was gracious and kind.

The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the cleaning services are really good. The breakfast was a bit poor, but for the really good prices they offer for the rooms, this was no problem to us at all.

Booked the hotel, with breakfast, to go down on our first morning to be told breakfast wasn't included in our room price.  We ended up having an argument…",Date of stay: September 2009,3.0

This was mentioned on day 1 of our 4 night stay and was not fixed through the stay! When this was brought up, I was asked why I had not advised them of this sooner, to which I replied I had and was met with a grin from the receptionist who was clearly unable or unwilling to understand.  The staff were OK, friendly when it mattered, but again confused when you asked them for something.   The main issue was the fact that they did not honour a payment made on ebookers and I was made to feel stupid and forced to hand over my credit card again…",Date of stay: September 2009,3.0

Whilst the location is superb, being close to the tube and local amenities, I would never stay there again due to a catalogue of failures on the part of the staff. I will detail them below and I promise I have neither exaggerated or embelished!!!!!!!.  We were told over the phone that there was luggage storage. Upon arrival, luggage storage turned out to be - you can leave them in the lobby, that is right next to the front door, next to a busy high street, with no security guard or other form of monitoring.  We ordered a superior room. Were given a standard room. We asked to be moved and were lied to by the receptionist and told that it was a superior room. They were actually willing to lie and charge us the extra…",Date of stay: September 2009,2.0

The moment I went down to the reception to inquire what was happening, I noticed that the fire escape door was blocked by large wooden plates, the restaurant exit doors had already been locked and the passage towards the reception had also been blocked by a large wall, leaving practically no possible escape. Part of the staff is amazing and constantly trying to compensate for the hotel management's mistakes (possibly due to amateurism or lack of training). Moreover, there was always noise from improvement works in the lounge and restaurant and no signal in the rooms, so I had to go outside to be…",Date of stay: August 2009,2.0

Stayed last night ffor 69 pounds.Its 20min tube from Embankment, so great for tourists as away from the hassle, more central this would be around 200 in my opinion. Lovely room, very trendy, not huge but apporpriate, good size bathroom with double rain shower.nice bed and cushions. Breakfast is continental but we found it was fine, toast, cereal, juices, joghjurt, pastries, jam, cheese, meat, fruit...maybe at weekend they could offer full english.anyway I would certainly recommend plus would stay again",Date of stay: July 2009,5.0

Initially I was annoyed, but they arranged a free bottle of champagne and covered the extra cost.   The hotel itself was newly opened. I checked in on Saturday the 18th and it opened on Thursday. As you would expect everything thing was brand new, though not everything had been finished.   I'm incredibly fussy so the small things matter to me and while there were a few issues they were all incredibly minor and didn't impact on the stay.   The room was well appointed with a lovely bed, linens and a absolutely fantastic bathroom. Powerful 'Rain' shower was lovely to use and the overall finish was of high quality.   Breakfast service could use a little…",Date of stay: July 2009,4.0
