This is an excellent base for looking around London if you are on a limited budget. However, the décor is a bit tired and the whole place could benefit from a lick of paint so don't book if you are expecting a swanky boutique experience. That said, the Adare Hotel is very good value for money by London standards and with the rising prices of all services and utilities etc, I doubt that the management/owners have much profit left over for paying for maintenance.
