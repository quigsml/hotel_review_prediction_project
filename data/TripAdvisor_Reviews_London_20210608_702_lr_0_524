So I'll give them feedback here because that't what they wanted.   I picked this place because it's close to Paddington Station and the pics I saw on Priceline looked nice. But the room was not as nice as the pictures.   First at all, this hotel has really weird structure. So may doors, bumps and stairs. I wonder how the handicapped people gonna stay there( probably they can only stay on the first floor) When we got off the super tiny elevator, there were stairs plus bump(WHY?)  so we had to jump over it in order to get to our room. Finally we arrive to our room so we opened the door, then we saw 2 more doors. One goes to the bathroom and the other goes to the bedroom. The bedroom was  just big enough for a double sized bed and I even could't open my suitcase on the floor.   The bathroom was terrible as well. The shower room was super tiny and it only provided either of cold or extremely hot water. Due to the temperature issue, I couldn't even fully wash my hair. And I dunno who installed the sink and shelf but every time I tried to wash my face there, I ended up bumping my forehead to the shelf. If I stepped back, I ended up getting my feet and floor wet because the sink was too small.   We didn't changed the hotel because we had to stay there only one night. If we had stayed there more than 2 nights, we would have moved somewhere else because staying there was simply painful.   Too bad I couldn't give them zero star but at least the view was pretty( there were 5 black boys filming rap music video right outside though lol)‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2020,1.0
