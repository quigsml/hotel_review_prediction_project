Soon as I got in, all was okay, checked in fine. Was then given my own linen to make my own bed. That's fine considering covid so I didn't mind. Get to the room and I wanted to walk back out, it was a mess!!! There were peoples shoed everywhere, clothes and items! Looked more like my brother's room than a hostel. I was told I could pick my own bed, which I was happy with until I saw the only two beds available were the very top bunk. And there were 3 bunks!! For me being short and being told I had to keep my things on the bed because of no lockers I was mortified. I had to throw my things onto the bed and trying to make it, I nearly fell a couple times and thought I was going to break an arm or leg! It was impossible!!  When it cane to night time, the bed wasn't too bad, only problem I had was the fact I was cramped in the bed with all my things at the end! I did not trust leaving my things on the floor with people coming in and out. There's also no lights near the beds so when turning off the main light, I had to trust the torch on my phone not to trip over someone's stuff.  Hardly covid clean too, most I've seen them do is dot around hand sanitizers and ask people to wear masks, no cleaners seen around to do the correct prevention of covid by cleaning facilities.…",Date of stay: May 2021,2.0

I was booked in & had paid for 3 nights, but after my first night I packed my stuff up and left, at 7am, went to an internet cafe, went online & found somewhere else to stay, and then sent them an email to give them the reasons I was not staying any longer & demanding a full refund (which I got).  The safety of this place concerns me.  The bathrooms are down in a basement, and there is no security on the ladies bathrooms, meaning anyone can get in there.  I bathed at 11am as I'd just come off a very long flight, and was frightened!  I don't understand why they can't code the female swipe cards so that only they can access the bathrooms.

The rest was awful.,"My sisters and I happened to stay at Russell Square quite by accident. We underbooked at another hostel so had to find another place to stay for one night. Our budget was about $30 Australian each. We booked into an 8-bed dorm at about $35 a night. The hostel was very hard to negotioate. We knew there was a bathroom and a laundry but we had a lot of trouble finding them.  The drom room was cramped, with minimum luggage storage. The bottom bunks were enclosed like cupboards with curtains that went across them. The top bunks also had the curtains but didn't have a ""roof"" like the bottom ones. The bottom bunks were unbearably hot due to the curtains, plastic covered pillows and matteresses and the heaters in the room that we could not figure out how to turn off.

For a start, you get assigned a room but beds are first-come-first-served. This favours the holidaying teenagers who hole up in hostels for weeks, spreading their shoes and hair-straighteners and dirty pants all round the floor; if you turn up in the evening, you're likely to be stuck in a third-tier bed (yes, the bunks are on three levels, not just two). You have to put your 'booking slip' in a little plastic wallet tagged to the bed, which makes you feel like a hospital patient.

Neither was the fact that I could hear the man in the room next to me un-zip his suitcase. This was BY FAR the worst hostel I have stayed in, in Europe.
