On check in staff were welcoming & allowed us into our room early so our little boy could use the bathroom. When they found out it was his birthday trip a card was left in our room for him!  Our room was sparkling clean! It’s clear staff are taking covid measures very seriously and it’s working. I felt so safe, which after shielding I didn’t think possible in a busy hotel environment.  But even the breakfast plates and bowls are now individually wrapped in cling film to stop cross contamination.  Overall the hotel is in a fantastic location for sea life, London Eye, South Bank. The staff make you feel welcome and relaxed the moment you walk through their doors. Comfy beds, clean facilities. You couldn’t ask for more.",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

I was there for just one night but the team made me feel really welcome and were able to accommodate my requests. I was allocated a lovely quiet room on the ground floor which was really spacious, which made working from the room on the Monday very comfortable.   Breakfast was simple, but well laid out with due consideration for COVID-19 security. The hot food was served by a team member and was hot and tasty.   I took advantage of the UK’s Latest Check Out promotion which meant I could complete a full days work from the comfort of the bedroom, before checking out at 5pm.   I realise things are far from normal at the moment, and that was reflective in the very favourable rate I got, but even when prices go up (as they inevitably will) I’d still consider staying at this property as it’s just so handy for Blackfriars station and the Southbank.…",Date of stay: April 2021,5.0

(Hopefully, this is a helpful review also for first timers to London.)  Overall Impression: An average but very decent hotel stay. Being a first time London visitor I tried to research a central hotel that wouldn’t break the bank and this seemed to fit the bill. I got a 40% off deal through Hotwire. Bonus at this location was that both breakfast and wifi was included. A downside is the construction next door that awoke us early every morning.  Location and Transit: In hindsight I would stay on the other side of the Thames as we had to cross over the bridge for 95% of our sight seeing. It was one of those ‘so close, yet so far away’ scenarios in that the hotel was a bit of a hike to many sights, but not really worth the Tube…",Date of stay: November 2014,4.0

The double bed was on the small side and an additional person, even a child, would have made the room quite crowded.  Storage space was limited.  Fotunately we did not have to worry too much about this as we did not unpack.  It would have been more problematic if we had been staying there for any length of time.   One or two things in the room would have…",Date of stay: October 2005,3.0

There were three of us sharing the room (all adults) but on arrival there was no linen for the sofa bed.  It took several attempts to get this sorted. Apparently, because I'd booked on the net, the room is only reserved for one person even though I'd paid a third person supplement(?)   The room was small as expected (especially for three adults!) but it was fine for somewhere to crash out.  The location is brilliant - right by the Tate modern.  We were able to walk from the hotel along the river and over to Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly and Oxford Street.  Having said that, I'm quite a keen walker!  All in all, a good budget hotel (paid £78 for one night) in a good location.  Everything was…",Date of stay: September 2005,3.0

As with most Holiday Inn Express hotels it is basic but clean.   Rooms are on small side so if you are a family staying for a while this may be a problem but a large room elswhere would cost an awful lot more.  Breakfast is continental buffet style it is adequate but for any Americans expecting a traditional full english then would suggest popping across road to Franks.  I have not eaten there but colleagues seem to recommend it (Also the place to buy sandwiches at lunchtime).   10 minute walk from Southwark tube station on Jubilee line. If your carrying cases and not too fit would suggest a taxi.

Our room was TINY ... with the sofabed open for our daughter, there was no place at all to walk around the furniture.  But it was all kept VERY clean.  Being on a lower floor and with the windows open, the garbage trucks woke us up at 7 am every day!  Convenient location ... near the Southwark tube station and near the Queen's Walk along the river ... several pubs and restaurants within walking distance.  The Tate Modern Gallery is close.  St. Paul's is directly across the river (pedestrian bridge).  In fact, we walked to the London Eye, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square and the Tower of London ... but I admit - that's a lot of walking!

Then we walked to the Hayward Gallery, along the Thames, and while walking back to Southwark street stopped at the newly-located Bramah tea museum on that street, a small and quaint museum where you can have a creamy tea.

Receptionists harassed but friendly. Found everything clean and acceptable. We had a double room at the back and found it very quiet – at £75 including continental breakfast for a London hotel great value! I  have to say we've never been disappointed with Holiday Inns in the UK, they provide a decent basic service for a reasonable cost. Although worried this hotel might be a bit out of the way it's only 10-15 minutes walk from Waterloo Station and handy for lots of good restaurants round about the Cut and side streets, as well as the tourist sites on the South Bank. If you're travelling by Eurostar it makes a nice stopover. Recommended. ",None,4.0

An easy walk to the South Bank of the River Thames and an excellent river front view of St Pauls, the City of London is only 15 mins walk from the hotel.

We were a family of 4, 2 adults, 2 kids, traveling to London for vacation. When we arrived, after traveling over 4,000 miles, booking months in advance, having the room guarenteed and with confirmation number, the Holiday Express Southwark claimed they had no record of our reservation. We even called direct and talked to reservations twice before we left on our trip to make sure everything was in order. We have proof of the phone calls and our credit card statement had a temp room charge pending. We were forced to stay in another Express much farther away from where we needed to be and it cost us so much more in transportation and headaches that it virtually ruined our trip.
