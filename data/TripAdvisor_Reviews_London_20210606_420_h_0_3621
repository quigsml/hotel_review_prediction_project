From start to end all staff were amazing, friendly and went out of their way to help.  From Abdel at front desk, to Kostas, Nelson, Emanuela and Vincenze in the restaurant/bar, we could not have asked them to be more helpful and friendly to us and our kids.  We were ofered prosecco and soft drinks for the kids on arrival.   The all day food and snacks were great for us and our kids and the selection of alcoholic drinks from 6-8pm were plentiful and good quality (eg Absolut vodka, great tasting Prosecco and Cabernet red wine).  The hotel is superb, the rooms clean and spacious and the views (from the 23rd floor) were stunning.  The breakfasts were delicious, we had the included Executive breakfast which was everything save for hot food (which suits our family).   The location for the hotel is perfect for sight seeing, being a short, safe walk from Oxford Street, Regent Street, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Hyde Park and Harrods/Knightsbridge.   We only live a 35 minute train ride from London and so this was our Covid mini holiday and now know how special tourists can be treated in our great capital city.     …",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

We were very impressed with the warm welcome back which included some lovely Christmas treats in our room and a welcome back card from from the hotel manager. We stayed in a Park Lane suite on the 25th floor which was beautiful with wonderful views across Hyde Park and beyond. The suite was spotless and the bed was extremely comfortable. We enjoyed an excellent cooked breakfast in the Podium restaurant and service and food quality was excellent in every way. Special thanks to Diana for such a warm welcome.

Declaration over, this was a very nice stay. It was my first hotel stay with my wife since the lockdown restrictions were eased.  Check in was simple and straightforward and I was told that I could have the room that I had booked immediately or if We were prepared to wait then they would be able to upgrade us to a suite. Naturally, we were happy to wait as we were going out of tea anyway so it was not a problem.  We were indeed upgraded to a very nice suite which was on the 24th floor and it gave us a magnificent view of Hyde Park and beyond.  Service was very good, our luggage was already in our room when we got there and the staff were all wearing masks and there were plenty of sanitising stations in the lobby and around the hotel.  A special shout out to Abdul, one of the guest relations team, who never seems to forget a face even if it is behind a mask as I was. He said he was delighted to see me again and that he was delighted to have us back in the hotel. He has been there for years and is much loved and trusted by guests and colleagues alike. He is super attentive without being sycophantic and he always has a smile and a kind word.  This hotel is not cheap, but not obnoxiously expensive either and I will definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it to others.…",Date of stay: April 2021,5.0

Because I just needed a stay for the night, I booked a straight Double Room with Kingsize Bed. We arrived late at night, at around 11 pm. The guy at check-in tried hard to sell us an upgrade, the first one costing us £ 600 more and when told that I would not spend that sort of money for just a night's sleep, he tried to convince me to pay £ 400 for a lesser upgrade.

I stayed in a room on the 22nd floor, overlooking Hyde Park: probably the best view I have ever had from a hotel window, it was stunning. The actual room was fairly spacious but to be honest, apart from sleeping in there, using the bathroom and admiring the view, I wasn’t in it that long during the daytime.

Then Hilton decided to go down the “high-end functional, business hotel” route and leave the luxury to others - except for this place, which is just terrific.  If, like me, you have stayed in Hiltons throughout the country on business, then the Park Lane Hilton will blow your socks off.  I mean no disrespect to the business hotel genre; its great to have clean, comfortable, well run hotels at reasonable prices, where everything just works.

The rooms are standard Hilton accommodations and are reasonably sized. Our shower could have benefited from more thorough cleaning to eliminate mildew in the grout but the space was otherwise presentable. We had issues with both the sink and shower drains and both were taken care of in a timely fashion by hotel maintenance. The public spaces are small and though not opulent are decent enough. The hotel would benefit from a more modern lobby bar rather than the tired Trader Vic's. The Mayfair location is a nice plus. This is a rather neutral review for a relatively neutral hotel: given the choice, I would likely stay in the same area but in a hotel with more character. ",Date of stay: June 2018,4.0

Feel a bit uneasy! ,Have stayed here many times because of its central location and because it's pretty good and dependable standard Hilton stuff. Plus 'free' nights courtesy of Hilton Honors are a bonus. BUT ... I got back last night at 11.30pm and checked out this morning very early 5.45am to catch a flight and was somewhat put off by groups of men (who had clearly had left their wives in the Middle East) and hookers hanging around the lobby area and the rear entrance which you have to use to access the underground car park. The night club and casino are the attractions near here so I doubt if I'll be staying again - I don't stay at The Mandarin for this reason either ...!!!

It's a dated building and not much to look at but the views are great particularly on a high floor. The rooms are fairly modern, service is good and staff well trained and the restaurants are pleasant. The family room (two connecting double rooms) was good value particularly as many other 'luxury' hotels do not guarantee connecting rooms.   It's some of the small things which prevent a top review such as the disgusting shower heads in both of our rooms, which urgently need to be cleaned of calc. Or the stained carpets which doesn't look very inviting. But overall this is a solid choice in a mid range 'luxury' hotel given the generally not great level of London hotels.

The Park Lane seems to be Hilton's second-nicest property in London, so I decided to give it a try.  I was a tad hesitant because the reviews seemed good, but not great, especially given how much more expensive the Park Lane property is compared to many of the other Hiltons (including the much-cheaper Green Park location, which is very closeby).

The location is close enough to walk to some of the main attractions in London (London Eye, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Harrod's, etc.) and there are bus and Underground stops very close by.  If I had one complaint, it's that the concierge came off as a bit unfriendly at times, and would often say ""You can take the Underground or bus"" without mentioning where to take them from, what lines to take, etc.  A nice hotel and the room we stayed in had a great view of the London Eye.

Our Park Lane suite was actually a nicely sized apartment. I especially took note of the high quality of wines being served (complimentary) in the club lounge.  The food selection also very nice.

Over the period of about the last 3 yrs. I've managed to stay at the great majority of Hilton hotels in the London area and a few more outside of London in the UK.  This was my 2nd stay at the Hilton London Park Lane and it has definitely become my fav hotel, Hilton or not, in London.  I do believe this hotel is vastly underrated in Tripadvisor.    The service at the hotel on this visit was outstanding.  I forget the young woman's name at the reception desk, but she provided a level of service that greatly exceeded my expectation.  I was upgraded to the most incredible suite with what had to be the best view of London.  During my previous stay I was in an ordinary room but also had an…",Date of stay: April 2012,5.0

Check in was quick and the concierge was very helpful in giving directions and tips on restaurants which were greatly appreciated. The room was recently renovated, clean, contemporary and comfortable but not too big. The toilet was small but clean and had all the basic necessities. The king size bed was big and comfortable and we slept well. The air con was working well and the bay window was nice to seat by to enjoy the view.  We got access to the executive lounge which was located at the first floor with the view of Hyde park. The food was nice and adequate for breakfast and you can relax here for tea or a…",Date of stay: August 2011,5.0

It was the third time I had stayed here in about two years and this time I paid for an upgrade to a executive room.  Check in at reception was far from smooth, partly as someone had managed to misspell my surname and partly as the receptionist was clearly inexperienced.  The room was fine with a good view of Hyde Park Corner but really lacked any sort of luxury feel or wow factor. For what I was paying I probably could have got a better room at The Landmark or maybe The Savoy for not much more.  Breakfast was included so I took it all three days. While very substantial and of good quality, the room is insufficiently large which led to queues and it being very busy on all three days.  Overall you seem to be paying a lot for the…",Date of stay: April 2012,4.0

Nice hotel, but definitely looks a little dated. More so the lobby. Rooms were fine. However for the price ££££, you expect a few little touches of luxury. Busy due to its location which is to be expected. Nice hotel.",Date of stay: February 2012,4.0
