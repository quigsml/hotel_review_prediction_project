It was still bitter and for the first time ever in a hotel, I slept in my clothes with my coat on top of me.!  The next day we arrived back at 11 p.m to find  the room as we had left it.  Unmade beds, no cleaning etc.  We went down to reception and again swapped to another very cold room.  A miserable stay, the staff on front desk offered 30% discount and said we could have had a choice of cleaning?  We are not psychic, we should have been given that choice, though now at the end of Covid,  that does seem a bit ridiculous.  I was telephoned after writing to the manager, but she did not say much apart from the change from summer/winter meant rooms colder.  This does not preclude a member of staff from heating one room up for the incoming guest!  Telling us it will be better in the future does not help us!  The clerk taking monies said he would email our receipt, even though he did NOT have our email address, so we never got one.  All he had to do was ask for it!  So we had to write and request it.  Using Covid as an excuse after all this time doesn't wash.  The after sales in the hotel is dreadful by all concerned.

I enjoyed having the sports bar downstairs. Good gym. Will be returning as long as the rate remains the same.

The two starters -chicken fritters and prawns, both with spicy dips - were unbelievably good.  We then went on, for mains, to have a chicken handi and a curried lamb shank which came with some excellent accompaniments - also delicious.  What made the meal even better was that we hadn't expected this high level of quality in a hotel restaurant, as opposed to an Indian restaurant which concentrates on this sort of cuisine.

We definitely chose right.  The hotel was about 5 minutes walk from Marble Arch (this was only a problem when it rained).  From the outside it is not that impressive at all, but once inside the surroundings were comfortable and inviting.  The staff were very friendly, the room was lovely.  We were supposed to have a room with a double bed, but it was more like a super king.  There was a small sofa and coffee table to relax.  The bathroom was immaculate.

It is true to say that Edgware Road (on one side of the hotel) is a centre for Lebanese restaurants but it is not true to give the impression that it is some sort of sinister area full of threatening Arabs.  Some of these restaurants are top of the range and the area is lively and perfectly safe for both male and female visitors.  It is no more dangerous than Chinatown!!!  You would only think it so if you were unused to seeing Lebanese or Middle Eastern restaurants in a concentrated area or if you found such restaurants somehow inherently threatening.

The Green Valley store is one block from this hotel and they have terrific pastry and food. This hotel is not far at all from an underground station and is absolutely in great shape inside. I was very very impressed. The only negative (and this might be characteristic of European hotels!) is that the minute you touch something in the mini-bar in your room, the sensors pick up movement and charge your room for that product. I had almost 55 pounds worth of material waived because of this - and they looked at us like we had seven heads. In other words, they had a hard time seeing why‚Ä¶",None,5.0

Initially we were planning to stay at the (more expensive) Marriott Park Lane, but when we booked, the only rates available were quite extortionate, which is why we chose the Marriott Marble Arch instead. I'm really glad we did too!  From outside, the hotel looks big and impersonal, but inside it's lovely. It has recently been refurbished and has been well looked after. We had an executive room on the 10th floor. Compared with other London hotels, the room was positively big - there was a king size bed, three-seater sofa, large coffee table, tub chair, desk & chair, and still plenty of room to move around in.

In the evening there were middle eastern men filling all of the outside chairs and standing around the arabic restaurants.
