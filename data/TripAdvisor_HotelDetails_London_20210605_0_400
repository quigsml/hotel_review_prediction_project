As light hits it, the shimmering shark-grey façade tricks the eyes – which is apt, given that Moorfields Eye Hospital is our neighbour. Optical illusions and visual surprises abound inside, too. Montcalm East draws inspiration from the art studios that blossomed in Shoreditch in the 1980s and 90s. Led by Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin and photographers such as Turner Prize-winning Gillian Wearing, a new breed of creatives revitalised this dynamic patch of London. Now it’s your turn. Experience our Creative Mark throughout: from our PhotoLab (where you can develop and print your pictures) to the Moor + Mead bar and restaurant, every detail is designed to delight. Additional highs come courtesy of 288 light-bathed bedrooms with camera-worthy views (many have floor-to-ceiling windows) and curated art and photography. Because living well has never mattered more, there’s also a reading room and a spa with a swimming pool, fitness centre and more. Even our airy, double-height lobby sets the tone in calm. Montcalm East zooms in on the innovative spirit of its setting – bohemian Shoreditch and tech-Titan Silicon Roundabout – and captures it with clarity, character and colour.

It was perfectly lovely. The hotel vibe is very reminiscent of Chateau Marmont in Hollywood ( another favourite hotel of ours) - which is understandable as they have the same owner. The all important ambiance and decor: Just lovely. Lots of 1930's elegance and creature comforts in the suite. Gorgeous bathroom , and a little sitting area and a fireplace next to the bedroom area .  The conversion of the old Firehouse is gorgeous- and the building itself is wonderful. Full on Victorian red brick glory. It's in a nice area of London, good shopping in Marylebone, and the Wallace Collection nearby is very worth a visit. The hotel staff were amazingly friendly and helpful. We dined at the restaurant twice during our stay- once alone, and the second time we were joined by a friend. Both meals were utterly delicious.  ( we had dined there a few years ago, right when it first opened, and it was really good then too. If they ask you to leave by the back after dinner, it's not a personal insult; there's a noise ordinance on Chiltern Street, and they have to quietly let diners out on the back side of the building for late  night departures. I read a review of the restaurant by a diner who was very offended by this ?) The bar was heaving every single night of the week, hard to get a seat, but the cocktails are amazing, and the vibe is super fun. The Ladderhouse suites are directly above reception and the bar, we were never bothered by noise. One time we came home to find our room smelling quite strongly of cigarette smoke. When we notified the staff, they made a very decent effort to investigate and clear the smell from the room.

Business and tourist guests arrive to an oasis of calm created in a beautifully restored historic Grade II listed building that combines modern style and luxury with a sense of place and distinguished grandeur. Surrounded by leafy churchyards and Grade I listed buildings, this landmark heritage hotel has a rich and fascinating history – from the East India Company building its first chapel and almshouses on the site in 1628 to the famous Labour politicians standing up for the poor of East London in the 1890s. With its landmark octagonal domed tower, the hotel is the centre point of this highly protected conservation area – surprisingly in its proximity to Canary Wharf – and provides a welcome retreat from the constant rush hour of international business on its doorstep.","['', 'Boutique', 'Romantic', 'English']","['90Good for walkersGrade: 90 out of 100', '65Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '5Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']","Street parking, Free High Speed Internet (WiFi), Fitness Centre with Gym / Workout Room, Bar / lounge, Tennis court offsite, Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly), Taxi service, Conference facilities, Wifi, Fitness / spa changing rooms, Sauna, Restaurant, Breakfast available, Breakfast buffet, Breakfast in the room, Complimentary instant cofffee, Complimentary tea, Kids' meals, Snack bar, Special diet menus, Wine / champagne, Meeting rooms, Spa, Steam room, 24-hour security, Baggage storage, Concierge, Newspaper, Non-smoking hotel, Outdoor furniture, Sun terrace, 24-hour front desk, Dry cleaning, Laundry service, Allergy-free room, Air conditioning, Housekeeping, Room service, Safe, Minibar, Refrigerator, Flatscreen TV, VIP room facilities, Bottled water, Non-smoking rooms, Suites","#143 of 1,167 hotels in London",414,"[286, 87, 23, 7, 11]","{'All languages': 414, 'English': 379, 'German': 9, 'French': 8}","['£83 - £212 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'United KingdomEnglandLondonDocklands / Canary Wharf / Isle of Dogs', '135']"
