After waiting 10 mins for the receptionist to greet you once she had finished her fag and decided to do her job, no apology to those she kept waiting and was very unpleasant to deal with slamming the key cards on the desk with no further instructions on where to go.   Arrived to the rooms where we were greeted with filthy carpets, dodgy taps, dirty bedsheets and a stale smell. No receptionist to complain to so had to put up with this and be thankful we only booked one night!   Thankful to leave the room we thought we would try out the dinner, when we arrived we were told there was a limited menu due to covid, we were basically told they could only cook us 1 dish, when it arrived it was burnt and hard, dessert was clearly frozen and microwaved leaving a half frozen cake. Breakfast in the morning was pretty much the same, only half the selection on offer and not unlimited like described! No vegetarian option and was only allowed 2 sliced of bread each as the rest was frozen. Stupidly they let us book this without telling us half the options weren't available. We just kept getting the same excuse of they weren't stocking goods due to another potential lockdown which is ridiculous.   Calling it a night we went back to the room to be greeting by loud drunks shouting and arguing from 11pm to at least 4am meaning hardly any sleep for us. Not wasting any time to check out in the morning there was no receptionist to greet us to check out and we let ourself out.   The only perks to this stay was how close the local sainsburys was and the DLR but that was soon forgotten about when arriving at the hotel  After this experience we will not be staying at another travel lodge and would much rather pay the extra to stay at a Premier Inn where the service is 100% better! …",Date of stay: June 2021,1.0

My kids were not strong enough to open it.   Air conditioning would be nice as you need to keep the window open which then let's in the noise of the revellers going home.   Good location.
