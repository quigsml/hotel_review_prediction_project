Just don't expect luxury or even the usual nice little touches such as toiletries (which I'm sure were mentioned in the ad' by the way) The room was tired but reasonably clean. It felt somewhat 'seedy' which might be a result of it being in the basement with no window to the outside world. I can imagine it's horrible in the heat of summer. You get added value if you like trains as the underground is clearly audible but I slept surprisingly well (must have been very tired)  Breakfast was ok and included in the price which is a rarity these days. Consisted of the usual beige continental buffet stuff with a choice of egg served as fried or omelette.  All in all, a bit clunky, a bit dated and a shade claustrophobic but as I say, it's London and the standards have dropped overall for what we as consumers are prepared to pay, so we can only blame ourselves.…",Date of stay: May 2019,3.0

Trust me, this is not how you want to save money. Skip a few meals or something, but don't book a room at the Hyde Park Court Hotel.
