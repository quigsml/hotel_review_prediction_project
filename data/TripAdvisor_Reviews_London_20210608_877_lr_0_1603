Stayed in a 8-bed mixed dorm, which was adequate albeit small. Bed was equipped with USB and power socket and reading lamp. However, the power went out on my last night and was unable to be sorted. Staff were great in trying to fix this though. The main positive of the hostel is the communal spaces which are excellent to work/chill in. There is also a large area downstairs where there is a kitchen to cook in (which I did not do during my stay) and a bar, with a great selection of drinks. I will return for the social aspects of this hostel.  ",Date of stay: February 2020,4.0

I'm a female solo traveller, stayed in a mixed dorm with 4 beds and felt perfectly safe. But this hostel is not for everyone, weekends are too noisy for sleep because of the (great) bar. The room ran quite hot even in February, lucky my bed was next to the window. Something that can't be excused however are the poor shape of the showers, dirty, and mattresses, worn down. But most backpackers are prepared for this. I would definitely stay here again for the social and fun, also why my rating is so positive.

Even inside the rooms is very noisy, not to talk about the common areas, impossible to get anything similar to a peaceful environment. It is fair to say that it's a hostel for young people and you could expect so, but the rooms facing the loud streets definitely make it way worse. The beds are super uncomfortable and there's not enough room to stretch properly.

The towels provided by the hotel had pubic hairs all over them and had quite obviously not been washed in months. My friend group elected to stay in an 8 person suite but instead of a room, we received a narrow pathway with bunks that were more like prison cells than beds. I cannot underscore enough how dirty the place was. In fact, I slept in my street clothes because I didn’t want my bare skin touching anything in the cell.

I'll start by saying remember this is a hostel, your experience relies heavily on who you share a room with and what you are there for. Of the 12 rooms I stayed in (a week at a time) I had only two incidents which made me seriously unhappy or uncomfortable and both of those were due to having inconsiderate people staying in the room with me.  The staff are amazingly helpful, easy to talk to and get along with and are always ready to jump to your aid.

The rooms were basic and small, with there not being a lot of room for bags. Given the low price of the dorm this didn't really bother me and the lack of space definitely contributed to that prison feel. If staying for more than a couple of nights I would probably look at finding a more spacious option.  The real standout of this place was the atmosphere and the staff.   The staff were extremely competent, friendly and helpful. The staff take late night noise reduction very seriously which was also great to see.  The atmosphere was outstanding with a large common room (court room) and an awesome bar down in the basement with cheap drinks and great vibe.  Would definitely come back here again.

The hostel was fine, but filled with groups of teenagers. The wifi only works in the lobby, not in the rooms. If Clink were more centrally located, it would be worth it, but it is a good 10 minute walk from Kings Cross, and there is not a lot to do in the surrounding area. It has all the amenities you want, was decently clean, and worked in a pinch, but unless you're looking to party with 20 year olds or are in a large group, you can stay somewhere closer and nicer for the same price.",Date of stay: June 2014,3.0

The lack of ventilation was so bad that is almost a crime, once you get up and make a run for it because you cannot fall asleep because of the stench of body odors, you find out that the entire hostel smells of body odor fumes, it is sooo disgusting.

Toilets we're dirty and smelly, the so-called luggage room is far from safe and the most terrible thing of all, the breakfast-room was an overcrowded and overnoised nasty place.
