But we asked for more at reception and they happily gave us loads more!  The location is perfect, a couple of minutes from Borough Market , which has loads of places to eat and drink...try the Market Porter pub...fabulous food and very friendly staff.

Firstly this was not a cheap night at £230. The room was dirty and smelled horrible - it smelled like a smoking room but wasn’t. The hotel is a rabbit warren of narrow corridors which I didn’t like. Service on reception was a best perfunctory. Breakfast is next door via corridor access. The room is small and breakfast selection is very poor for this price.

The only complaint is about the Anchor pub which is attached to the hotel. We called in there three times for a drink and had a bit of trouble getting served on all 3 occasions. We did have the breakfast one morning and this was great. I would recommend this hotel. The quickest route to the hotel from London Bridge station is to take the Borough High St West exit and turn right into Stoney St at the Southwark Tavern keep going as far as you can and turn left down Ckink St and the hotel is directly in front of you.
