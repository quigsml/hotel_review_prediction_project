The hotel itself was absolutely lovely, with very friendly and helpful staff and a perfectly clean and comfortable room. I had paid for the Works, but the little bit extra money was absolutely worth it. It was odd though that the staff prepared a separate sofa bed with a duvet and pillows for our 10 months old baby??!! The room was otherwise quite safe for the baby to crawl around with our supervision. The breakfast was really good, served on a tray with a nice variety and fresh coffee, and we could eat it all in the breakfast room. The lady serving the breakfast was super nice and helpful. In sum, it was a great stay and I have decided to give all five points after all ;) …",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

A* Assistance, Early Check-in & Upgrade!","I arrived following a most unpleasant experience in Germany the days before where I was robbed. Having come back to the UK on an early flight, I headed directly for the hotel where I hadn't stayed before, only to be greeted with unexpected generosity by the staff, especially Diana, who helped me with directions to the nearest bank, opticians, as-well-as providing me with a room upgrade and a very early check-in without any additional fees. This was exactly what I needed given the circumstances, and as such, it made my time in London so much the better, whilst simultaneously, relieving a great deal of stress. Consequently I'd recommend this establishment to the paying public, whether for business or touristic purposes. The location is safe, central; and the interior of the hotel - modern and sleek.

The hotel is ideally located near local facilities, restaurants etc, but I found the design and character of the hotel to be its greatest asset. As with all Ibis Styles, the hotel carries an individual decoration - setting them apart from other chains, and making them more welcoming and comfortable as a result. I really enjoyed the London subway decoration and signage - though imagine it might not be everyone’s cup of tea.   The room was certainly on the cosy side, but for London you pay for space. That said, there was still plenty space to work at the desk away from the bed, and plenty room in the bathroom too.   If needing to stay in this part of London again I’d definitely return.

We wanted to save a bit of money for this business trip. Never again. Room was so small it was the hotel that was saving on space not me on money. Price per square meter must be skyhigh.

Check in was super quick, as I did this online before we arrived. Our room was compact, but really clean, had everything we needed and we were lucky enough to have a balcony room.

We would have left the balcony doors open had it not been for the constant noise of the building works on the hotel (which was never mentioned on our arrival or before booking)  the only redeeming factor was they honoured the note I left when booking by asking to help make my partner's birthday special to which they provided a drinks voucher and cupcakes. I try not to be negative on these sites but was just left feeling…,Date of stay: March 2019,2.0

However, although your staff were charming and tried to be helpful, and the location was ideal for us, we were very disappointed with this stay. Our room (655) was extremely small and cold. On one side, the bed was almost against the wall and the mattress was not comfortable. The bedside lights did not work and apparently could not be fixed until morning. The towel rail was not on and the water did not get hot. There was nowhere to put luggage nor chairs to sit on. The only places to hang clothes were ridiculously inconvenient. We paid £132.05 for our overnight stay and feel we did not receive value for money. This is no way to treat customers; we would not stay in your hotel again and could not recommend your hotel to anyone…",Date of stay: April 2019,1.0

Upon arrival I was informed there wasn't a booking in my name. I had a print out with me so handed this over. They hurried off into a back room, returned a couple of minutes later with a key card. Suddenly there was a room available. Before I continue I need to explain the booking.com description and photos of this room indicate a seating area within a space double bedroom with large windows and one photo had the window/door leading to a terrace. We were led downstairs to the basement level to a room right at the bottom of the stairs (room they have left over for bookings they have forgotten??) in here there was a window, however right near the ceiling and very small, basically no natural light is in this…",Date of stay: March 2019,2.0

There are 2 grocery stores within about 1/2 block. We were assigned a room on the 5th floor. After waiting for slow elevators, we went to the room and it was HOT!  The windows didn't open and the A/C would not come on. When I called down, I was told they were having problems with the A/C in some areas. Did I want to move to a different room on the ground floor? Yes!  We ended up with a room next to the lobby. It was bigger than the other room and the windows actually opened.  The A/C turned on but showed error messages.  Later I ran into a worker who asked me how things were - I told him the A/C doesn't appear to be working well. HE said ""Oh, we're…",Date of stay: March 2019,4.0
