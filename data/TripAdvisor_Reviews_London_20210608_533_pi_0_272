No more no less than 3 stars. You know sometimes some 2 stars hotels feel like 4 and other times, 4 stars hotels feel like 2. Not the case with Eurotraveller Hotel. It is exactly what you would expect from a 3 stars hotel. It has the basics, doesnt offer too much but its clean. Nothing to complain about as per say, but nothing to write home about either.  I would come back again for work purpose but not with the wife and kid for sure. Not really a touristic, romantic hotel at all. Overall, 3 stars hotel, 3 stars review.

Awful stay, awful service. No customer care whatsoever. Unpleasant reception staff that were surprised to see me; someone half decent has checked in for once!  Asked for a poached egg at breakfast and the Breakfast Manager was called to my table to ask me what the problem was!!!! The receptionist didn't even know the difference between a poached egg and a boiled egg. I was told that I had to request the poached egg with ""24 hours notice"" despite being told that there was a ""chef"" and a ""gas cooker"" in the kitchen! I approached the front desk to make my request (couldn't believe what I was doing), and was told that the manager would be infomed and that ""something will be done about it."" Over an egg!?!? Seriously?! And not to mention the fact the receptionist laughed about it! How ridiculuous! Nothing happened and I didn't get my poached egg the next day. Limited selection of breakfast food with sausages that were half the size of my finger and rashes of bacon cut exactly to the size of my finger! I've never come across a ""Premier Hotel"" that provided such poor value for money! Pain au chocolat and croissants were cold; the so-called grill wasn't working! What else could go wrong?  Oh, the room. No wardrobe; all of my clothes remained in the luggage for my entire stay! Not even a peg to hang my coat on so it was hung on the back of my chair throughout! The short clothing rail was above the writing desk!! I've never known anything like it! The desk was installed infront of the bed so there was little space for me to use the desk anyway! The toilet roll holder in the bathroom was far to low; if only it was positioned higher! I might be 5 ft 8.5 inches tall but even I struggled! Don't be fooled; everything looks bigger and taller in photos! The shower was handheld so my showers were very awkward. The hook for the shower head was mid-level so I couldn't enjoy a hand's-free shower!   I lost my beautiful cashmere scarf; I think I left at the local McDonalds. I asked the receptionist to phone them on my behalf and he was inattentive. He waited for a few seconds and put the phone down after ""No answer; sorry."" Didn't even bother trying to phone them again or even show any sign of care. I phoned them myself and they answered straight away.    On the last night of my stay, I could hear loud music coming from somewhere nearby. Phoned reception from my room to complain and two members of staff knocked on my door to ask me what the problem was; I had to tell them again despite me telling them over the phone!! It was apparrent that the local restaurant was celebrating Chinese New Year, fair enough but the music was too loud! I was told that the restaurant will be asked to turn it down; that didn't happen! Nothing happenned; I was completely ignored! I was shown to a different room but I was checking out the next morning so there was no point! The staff didn't ackowledge this at all; they just decided that the best thing for me was to move to a different room.They really should've done their homework on me before asking that question! And the same thing could be said when they asked me TWICE to pay for my breakfast when it was pre-booked! Utterly disgusting!   On check out day, I asked to leave my bags in the SMALL store room so I can collect them after breakfast and check out; I was asked when I will be collecting them: ""Today or tomorrow?"" I couldn't believe it! I told the assistant: ""I'm checking out after breakfast so I'm going to need by luggage."" To which he rudely replied ""Yes but do you need your bags today or tomorrow?"" Couldn't believe what I was hearing! After breakfast, I asked for my luggage and the assistant couldn't find it; I had to point it out to him!!   When I checked out, no goodbye from any of the staff. Nothing. No acknowledgement. Not even a ""Thank you for your stay"" or ""How was your stay?"" Nothing. Poor value for money indeed! Don't stay here!…",Date of stay: January 2020,1.0

Yes, the location is 'out of the way', but that is why you're paying lesser prices. There are plenty of bus stops which can take you to Tower Bridge / Westminster in no more than 10 minutes.

Its closest Tube Stop is Elephant & Castle (which has a lovely market with good Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Ethiopian Food, sometimes Traditional Hungarian Food, Smoothies, and cheap stuff ...). From there, good luck finding New Kent Road, but when you do, take one of the many buses that go to Old Kent Road (there are two bus stops close to each other, and you wait at the SECOND bus stop).

Check in was smooth, rooms were fantastically clean and very modern and spacious, there was a bus stop only a minute away which takes you into central london (takes about 20mins or so).  The location was the only slight downside as it a bit confusing to get to, the nearest tube is elephant and castle (not tower bridge as you might expect), but reception staff are very helpful with giving directions etc.  Old Kent Road is not the best street in London (its the cheapest plot on the monopoly board after all!), but apart from that, lovely modern hotel and had a great nights stay  :-)",Date of stay: May 2010,4.0

The rooms were quite large compared to others in the same price range we experienced round europe. They were modern and the bathrooms were extremely clean. The only negative was the location. It was a bit far out (25 minute bus ride to trafalgar square) however there were constant buses going to the city centre (approx. every 7 minutes). It is in a bit of a lower economic area however it was quite safe to walk the 50 meters  from the bus stop alone at night (for a female) as there are businesses open at all hours. It was far easier to use the bus then the underground.,Date of stay: January 2010,4.0
