Have had a pleasant visit to London this time too but I will not use the premier plus service again.   The rooms I have had previously have been spacious and comfortable. With the world upside down we felt we deserved a little treat and so we upgraded to Premier Plus. We felt like we’ve stayed in a donkey box for two nights. Rooms are tiny, teeny tiny. We’ve been tripping over and bumping into each other. Awful view from the room and a funny smell from the bathroom.

There was a person there who quickly and effecient sorted this. The room was clean, OK and pretty average as you might expect from a Premium Inn. The highlight was the bed which was very comfortable and I got a good night's sleep. The room was a slighly odd T-shape and this meant that the desk was in effectively an alcove which meant it was gloomy even with the desk light on.

We weren’t wanting to spend much so I went straight to the premier inn website as you know you’ll get what you pay for with them! I feel like prices were much cheaper than usual (assumedly due to reduced custom at the moment from the Covid pandemic).

One slight problem with some of the London ones is that the rooms in these old buildings can be very small, and in fact it was not possible to use the desk because the bed left no space to sit in the chair - if on a business trip, it may be worth asking for a room large enough for this to be possible!
