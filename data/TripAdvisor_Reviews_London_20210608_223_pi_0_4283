We were surprised by the quality of this Premier Inn. Our room was quiet and spacious. The bed was very comfortable, black out curtains were useful, and the kettle and coffee facilities were a real plus for our early departure. Large screen TV and relaxing bathtub too. The young lady we saw on reception was welcoming and helpful.Her attitude to customers was top! All the staff we saw were pleasant. Great location for sightseeing, with restaurants and pubs close. Extremely clean. I travel a lot for leisure and for work, and this hotel was incredibly good value. It is definitely my first choice for central London. For me  it far outstripping travel lodge in comfort and value for money (maybe it was cheaper because of the covid crisis right now, but cerrainly excellent, suitable for long and short visits to London).…",Date of stay: September 2020,5.0

Bad customer experience at Premier Inn.,"Stayed in February this year and were not very happy with staff ignoring a guest spoiling breakfast and evening meal/drinks..this lady was left to keep spitting on floor and making sudden and weird movements in front of guests,  shouting and screaming - this lady was obviously from afar should not have been left unattended and should have been asked to move to a more appropriate area and not left in front of guests who were trying to eat and drink.. this was so basic and all that happened was a young girl from premier just said stop spitting on the floor and walked away.

All in all not to bad as premier inns go. A touch on the pricey side. On a further note and as a seasoned premier inn guest the new menu is not very impressive. The old menu was better and more varied. I had a rump steak which came with fence fries snd green beans. The steak was a bit chewy but acceptable and the fries were a bit soggy. I love staying at premier inns but i find the food doesn't always come up to scratch. I will continue to stay at premier inns but won't rush to dine there.  ,Date of stay: May 2015,3.0

I chose this one in London as it was newly refurbished. It was a good choice. We were celebrating my Christmas Day 70th birthday so I booked two rooms for a family celebration. We were given rooms right opposite each other so that was really convenient. It was like staying in a brand new hotel. Everything was clean and shiny. The beds were very comfy. The only snag was that the 4th bed in the family room was not pulled out or made up. I asked for this to be done and was assured it would be. After a very full and tiring sight seeing day, we returned late to find that the bed was still not done. This meant a delay before we could get the children ready for bed.

To be REALLY good 1) Why so many details when checking in?  Passport #? Next destination? 2) No AC controls in the room.  This always seems odd to me, given the wide variation in preference you will see from travelers. 3) No shower door!!!

The staff were very helpful when checking in. The room was on the top floor and was amazing value for money for London. It was a very large room that was spotless. The only things I would say is that I wasn't happy I had to ring an 08 number to contact reception and a family was next door to us who were really loud very early in the morning. However on the whole if you are looking for great value for money and the noise of children doesn't bother you too much then this is Definately the hotel for you,Date of stay: September 2014,4.0

Location was ideal, straight across from British library, welcome from staff was beyond brilliant, such a friendly bunch of people. So genuinely nice. Room was wonderful, I booked two rooms and they were next door but one to each other which was ideal. Great view of the library. No noise from outside whatsoever. Breakfast was wonderful. Staff dressed at Jessie from Toy Story to keep the kids entertained. (We didn't have any with us but it was great for those that were). Check in and out just so easy and quick. Only downfall was the vending machine out of order so hubby had to walk to mcdonalds down the road to get a drink at 4am! Would definitely return here.
