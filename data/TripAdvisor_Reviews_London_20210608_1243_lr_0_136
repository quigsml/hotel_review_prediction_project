This was without doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.  The room was dirty; the floor was dirty, the beds were dirty, the surfaces were dirty.  The lights did not work.  The TV had no remote control. There was so much noise inside and outside the hotel, all night. The lift felt as if it would break down any second.  The bathroom and shower areas had so much mould.  The staff obviously did not care about any of these things. I can well believe what people said in other rooms about fake photos being posted.  I would rather sleep on the streets than stay here again. Please, please, please, please, do not make the same mistake I did; read the reviews and trust that they are the truth.

We arrived and there was no staff in uniform or with name badges.   The room (45) we found had no working air conditioning and the radiator was very hot even after we turned it off before going out. The window overlooked the fire escape and had a lot of litter outside (surely a fire risk).  The Bathroom had chips off the units,a rusted bin, the bath had black ingrained dirt and limescale . There was no proper seating to eat, only a coffee table.   We complained and we were moved to room 46 which was smaller but a lot worse- the fire alarm was hanging off the ceiling, permanent marks on the cupboard, the remains of the wall mounted lamps had wires still on the wall, white substances can be seen by the radiator and in the bathroom. There was no light bulb in the lamp despite being left on. Same issue with the radiator being very hot even after we turned it off. The air conditioning was broken therefore it was very hot during the night. The floor tiles were broken in the bathroom and around the sink, there was paper peeling off in the bathroom, the same comments apply for the bath as in room 45. The mattress was sinking in the middle.   When we moved rooms the staff were speaking in a foreign language and they couldn't understand when we complained.     The only good thing was the location and the unique decor lift.

You book a room expecting it is actually booked   I was then re directed via booking.com to a sub standard hotel in a totally different area. Not surprising that then it was 11pm not much choice .

Well when booking readt he description. It is a Victorian building so has some wear and tear. We had a nice clean room with fresh towels every day. We were never asked for extra money for cleaning. The staff were really lovely and friendly. You choose breakfast the night before and choose a  time with 30 minute window. Works well..not big portion but adequate. The hotel is right in the middle of knightsbridge so everythingi s on the doorstep step. The lift is old-fashioned which is what you would expect for age of building.
