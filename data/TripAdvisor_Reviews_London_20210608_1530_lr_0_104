According to the hotels own terms I should not have been charged a dime. I was charged £697 a week ago at which point I called them only to be met with silence from the person on the other side of the phone once they realised the nature of my complaint. I seriously mean that the hotel employee or owner (I dont know who I was speaking to) suddenly just decided to stop responding until I got fed up and hang up. They then simply refused to pick up the phone when I tried to ring back. A whole week later I am still £697 poorer with no communication from the hotel. I don't know about anyone else but I certainly cannot afford to loose £697! Please, please, please avoid this chain like the plague.

However, when I went to the hotel, I was not accepted to the hotel. They simply said that the place was not a hotel but rather it was a home office place. But just above the door, there was a huge sign written Oyo Sino Hotel. Therefore, it was a lie, so be careful if you have a reservation for this hotel. Nevertheless, it would be good for you to be not accepted by the hotel since there are better hotels with the same tariff around.

They never answer conplaint emails. There was no WiFi in my whole 7 day stay. The owner told me to my face the third day that I would have internet in one hour, I left on day 7 and there never was. Nobody came to talk to me after that. Very cowardly. Nobody cleaned the room in 7 days. I had to start bringing rubbish down every time I went out. No toilet paper refill, no fresh towels. There was no hot water the last three days. It was very hard to find somebody at the front desk, and when I did, they were pretty much useless. The managers are thugs, no matter how much you complain, they won’t refund your money (while holding the key to their fancy Mercedes Benz in their hands) and they will lie to you and to booking.com saying everything works. I called booking at least 6 times to complain, every time they got back to me saying the hotel told them that everything worked. The bed was broken. I did not get changed to another bed (room) until the third day.  If you respect yourself and your loved ones, stay away from this dodgy dump, it is not worth anything.
