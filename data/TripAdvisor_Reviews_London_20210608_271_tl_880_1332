I booked the hotel on line and though I was being smart taking advantage of their evening meal deal and all you can eat breakfast - not a smart move after all.

I was greeted by a friendly and helpful receptionist, and this was repeated again and again by the other receptionists I saw, the staff in the cafe, and the cleaning staff. There must be an inbuilt culture to be friendly and helpful. It certainly makes you feel very welcome.

I suggest the huge Chinese restaurant across the street which is quite good. Apart from that one there is absolutely nothing nearby, no shops, no places to eat, nothing. Still the DLR is quite close and in Beckton there is a huge supermarket.
