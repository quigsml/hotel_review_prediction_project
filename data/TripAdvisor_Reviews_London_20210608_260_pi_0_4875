The hotel is ideally located and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Some of the disappointment was down to guests staying next door to us who insisted on slamming their door over 20 times in an hour late at night as they had friends staying in the room opposite. They continued to do this til 2.30 in the morning. I politely asked them to close the door gently but was met with complete ignorance and this spoilt our first night as my child and I struggled to sleep. Fortunately they left the following day otherwise I was going to speak to reception and ask to be moved.  The biggest issue was breakfast. When we checked in we were informed that a table didn‚Äôt need to be booked and could just turn up. We turned up at what was deemed on the poster in the lift to be a quiet time and had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. I‚Äôve stayed in other premier inn hotels during the pandemic and always booked a table for breakfast which aided the flow and allowed social distancing so I‚Äôm somewhat confused as to why that wasn‚Äôt the case this time. The staff were run off their feet and were very apologetic but felt this could be improved upon with table bookings. Some guests walked out and others left as they had tickets for London eye etc. Fortunately we could wait but I felt the time waiting was excessive. It also seemed to be that if those in front of the queue needed a table for 4 yet there was only a table for 2 available, everyone had to wait, they didn‚Äôt bring the next 2 waiting to fill the available table. But as the staff were run off their feet, I don‚Äôt think things were thought through thoroughly. The breakfast once served was lovely.  The hotel is a little tired looking but still provides good value for money.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: May 2021,3.0

No.   This member of staff appears to be making up her own licensing hours. Perhaps she was tired, they do work hard there‚Äôs no doubt. But this bar used to stay open until midnight catering well for people coming back from their various nights out who want to discuss the evening over a couple of drinks.

The hotel lived up to it's good night sleep promise. I would recommend this hotel for simply value for money coupled with the hotel getting all the basics right. An added bonus is the fact that the chain offers to replicate the same experience in it's numerous properties all over the place so even location is not a constraint. I myself saw two other premier inn properties within 5 minutes walking distance and a number of others spread over the various places I went to in U.K..

Unfortunately the volume control had been taken out of my hands by Premier Inn who had decided to limited the maximum volume to about 20% where it stuck.  I couldn't hear it so therefore had no access to the television at a volume comfortable for me.

I have to compliment the hotel staff who are very helpful (especially the duty mgr - Dyane) and being patient as well. The downside will be the cafe that serves breakfast (starts at 6.30am weekdays and 7am on weekends) which gets too crowded‚Ä¶",Date of stay: September 2014,4.0

My first choice of hotel was fully booked and after a very bad experience at another Premier Inn, I was not particularly looking forward to going back.

I was travelling in and out of Kings Cross and St Pancs and the hotel is a short walk from both.  The Stand, Totenham Court Road, Covent Garden and the West End are all within walking distance.

No bells or whistles.,"I've stayed at this Premier Inn a couple of times now, generally for the location. You can fall off the train at Euston, St Pancras or Kings Cross and straight into the hotel.  The rooms are standard Premier Inn - average size, good (high) beds, functional bathrooms. Nothing stunning, nothing terrible. There's a feeling that they don't want you staying for long- the lack of a wardrobe that closes a door on your clothes and no drawers emphasises this.  Food-wise, the food downstairs for dinner is fine, although I did feel stupid carrying it to my own room covered in foil (I don't like eating alone in a restaurant). Breakfast is very good for the price.  Check in and out are functional- I do object to the machine check in, it's so impersonal and smacks of not wanting to welcome‚Ä¶",Date of stay: October 2013,3.0

A very short walk from Euston station, so the trains, tube and buses are right on your doorstep.

The hotel was relatively easy to find - I walked from Euston Square Tube and it took about 10 mins to get there from the Tube as I had luggage. It's even closer to Euston Station (Tube and mainline), which are literally about 3 mins walk away.  You enter the hotel from Duke's Road (which is just off Euston Road). The lobby isn't very big but has enough space and several of the usual Premier Inn check-in self-service counters. As usual, check-in was fairly quick and easy.

The day-time staff (girls) were lovely, the night-time staff (boys) could be a bit more accommodating. The guy who checked in just before us (c.11pm) returned to Reception as he'd just gone into his room and found someone asleep!! Luckily that didn't happen to us. The big problem is the price. I had to pay ¬£154 which I found appalling but I kept looking out for something decent and cheaper until the night before - 1pm cancellation policy - and couldn't find anything.

While many of the travelodge, holiday inns, premier inns, etc. tend to blend into one another it was really nice to stay at one that will linger in the mind as it had no problems and great staff. The whole place was clean, tidy and the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. The room was no surprise with all the usual stuff, a little small but fine for two. There was the potential for noise as the walls seem a little thin but we were at the rear of the hotel so noticed no traffic. Room and bathroom all very clean and tidy. Also had a snack at the restaurant downstairs (1 Duke Street? I think) which seemed fairly good value for money in‚Ä¶",Date of stay: July 2008,4.0

Sadly it was let down by the people staffing the restaurant who were rude and didn't seem to give a s..t  about what they were doing. In particular there was some Turkish or possibly Greek-looking gentleman behind the bar whose attitude really stank. But anyway, for the price (about 100 quid a night) you can't really complain. Overall good value",Date of stay: June 2008,3.0

I can't recommend this hotel highly enough, As I was travelling to London alone with my daughter I had a number of concerns before I left eg would the hotel be noisy at night from other guests, would the room be big enough for a weeks stay as we would be staying in from about 9pm, would the hotel be child friendly? I have to say on all these counts the hotle was excellent. They have a good nights sleep policy which seems to mean that you get your money back if you are disturbed at night etc. We did not hear any noise during our entire stay, the rooms seem to be fully insulated and you couldn't even hear TV etc from other rooms. The rooms themselves are big enough- we had a queensize bed and a full sized‚Ä¶",Date of stay: July 2008,5.0

I would highly recommend this hotel.  On arrival we were greated by a very friendly and helpful receptionist.  Our room was quite spacious and really clean.  It was very warm and we could not open the windows but thankfully they provide a fan in the room which is definately needed.  The all you can eat breakfast was amazing and the hotel restaurant at night was fantastic value and the food was delicious.  The only downside I could find was the location.  it is quite a walk to get to the major attractions but there were always cabs and buses about.  Overall I would recommend this hotel for a short break.  I would have no hesitation in staying there again.,Date of stay: July 2008,4.0

The room and bathroom was spotlessly clean with good quality linen, pillows and towels. Superb power shower too!Tea / coffee / biscuits were provided with a decent kettle and (surprise, surprise) a proper hairdryer! What a rarity! Our room was very quiet (at the back of the hotel) and I honesty didn't hear one siren all night! It's crowning glory is its'  very close proximity to both Euston and St Pancras  - as long as your luggage has wheels both are only moments away. Breakfast was excellent (continental and hot) but a downside is that food is only served unitl 10pm in the evening - we‚Ä¶",Date of stay: July 2008,5.0
