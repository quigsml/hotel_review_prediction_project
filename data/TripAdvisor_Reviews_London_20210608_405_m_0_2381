The Quay area outside the hotel has a number of good restaurant choices or the option to float around the Quay in a BBQ Boat!  We were given a room upgrade which is always nice, but had difficulties with noise from the DLR trains. The room we were initially given on level 2 was at track/wheel height. We were moved without any complaint to a room on the sixth floor, where there was still some train noise.  The room itself was great with a separate seating area and dressing room. There's a comment below about Standard Def. TV - ours was definitely HD. More minor things - the bin hadn't been emptied from the previous guest, parts of the tea & coffee service were missing.  Note the advertised Executive Lounge service - one of the reasons we chose to pay more for our room - had not restarted after 17 May. A reduced service is offered in the lobby. Again minor, but this sort of thing bugs me when a hotel chain knowingly misleads customers.  The team were exceptionally friendly. Really good, very attentive and keen to know that all was OK.  I'd stay again, but I'd pay less for a smaller room with a Quayside view instead.  We used JustPark to park a short distance away in Westferry Circus for £10 per night.…",Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

In addition, since i wasn't in the hotel i had limited access to hotel facilities.  So i said ok that's fine, just move me to the hotel.  The front desk told me they couldn't because i prepaid.  Really, you are going to get more money if i move to the hotel.  Sorry sir we can't move you.  I was nice but  i find situations like this a reflection of management.

Pretty good.,"My partner and I stayed here for one evening, and had a lovely time. Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the water, with a nice little view. Reception and door staff were helpful, friendly and professional, the room was a decent size, and location was fab (in the heart of Canary Wharf, and 2 mins from the DLR station). We didn't manage to grab food or drink in the hotel, but the restaurant looked great, with huge windows allowing for diners to look out onto the quay as they ate. One gripe would be there was nowhere in our room for me to sit down and do hair and make up. A few mirrors, but all either in the bathroom, tucked into an alcove, or behind a desk (which was longways, so miles from the mirror). Other than that, really enjoyed our stay at this place.",Date of stay: September 2012,4.0

However, I felt that the rest of the staff (i.e., front desk staff) treated us with disdain. I felt that if I asked them even a simple question, it was too much to give us the answer.

Canary Wharf has gone through rapid development in the past few decades, from a barren docklands, to a vibrant and handsome second center for London business.  There are very few hotels in this area, and the Marriott is both relatively reasonable and a very acceptable accommodation. I need to emphasize that Canary Wharf is not a good location if tourism is the main purpose of your stay in London.  While there are some good transportation choices (DLR, Underground, ferry), it’s relatively far from central London (it is, however, very close to the Olympic Village).  Therefore, its primary function is as a business hotel.   With this in mind, how does the Marriott fare as a hotel?  Overall,…",Date of stay: April 2012,3.0

West India Quay area is great and the breakfasts at All Bar One and Wetherspoons are excellent value for money.  Be aware if you are arriving by DLR from Bank the DLR does not stop at West India Quay and you have to get off at Canary wharf and either walk or take a DLR from the opposite platform back towards Bank to get off at West India Quay.

The down comforter & down pillows were very comfortable and luxurious. It took me a second to figure out how to use the shower, but that could have happened to me in any London hotel.  The Canary Wharf area is where many Londoners go to work, so there’s a lot of people…",Date of stay: July 2004,5.0

I stayed in the West India Quay over the weekend and it was worth the price Of 80pounds (about $155 USD). I needed a place to stay for my first night due to the fact the hotel was DOUBLE the price+ (translating back to about $320 USD) per night on weekdays (This was a Thursday). I would definitely not pay over 90 pounds for the hotel unless you are getting a ""Executive room/executive suite""... I stayed in a quality room (std.). Something that mislead me was the fact they show a beautiful tower over-looking the Canary Wharf. This is not the case - there is a little back-part of the tower that has a different styling that is less-impressive and not-really-a-tower period = this is where you will stay unless you get an…",Date of stay: February 2005,4.0

We loved it.  I agree with all the great things previous reviewers have said ( bar one gentleman who had a bad experience) This is a great place to stay with older children. There are plenty of nearby restaurants which have childrens menus. The cinema is just across the road and plenty of shops. I can not fault the hotel or the area. If you join Marriot Rewards on-line you can get a great weekend rate until 31 May'05, which includes a London bus tour/river cruise. We've booked a B+B package next time as RO can be very pricey if you eat breakfast in the hotel, although there are plenty of other options around the locality. The breakfast was excellent by the way. Give it a try. I can…",Date of stay: February 2005,5.0

I love the location, the hotel, the staff, the rooms.  The hotel is pretty new and boy does it show.  The architecture in West India Quay is mainly glass and steel and the hotel is just that way.  The rooms are decorated in an ultra-modern fashion but still felt warm and homey.  I found the room to be spacious and the bathroom was very roomy.  The staff was very hospitable - we called down to get a bucket of ice delivered because the machine was broken and there was a knock on our door no later than 30 seconds after we had hung up (remarkable orientation to customer service in my book!).  The location is great because West India Quay is a financial district so there's not really any…",Date of stay: November 2004,5.0

The rooms were hot, halls were oven-hot, fire alarms sound in the middle of the night, no hot water one morning, phone didn’t work at first (then was charged $3.00 for picking it up), had a mini-bar charge just for looking (the computerized mini bar worked!), no hot water in the sink, interactive TV services didn’t work. Restaurant staff was inattentive. Asked the concierge for directions to the London City Airport and he didn’t know. He did call someone to ask for directions and after a couple of hours provided a map. There is no pool nearby and the pool at the closest heath club costs $10 a swim. The hotel's health club was tastefully decorated, dimly light, and below standards for a “5-star” hotel. Avoid this hotel. There are better…",None,2.0

I stayed 3 nights during the week it opened (around the 19th of June 2004).  Everything was so new, I even removed the plastic from my lamp and had to plug in a few other appliances!!  It was such a treat to be the first one to stay in that room...so nice to stay in a hotel where everything is sparkling new.  The hotel is a tribute to modern chic design and beauty...lots of light coloured woods, plus an abundance of flowers, marble and stonework.  The elevators are very modern and quite nice.   The rooms are wonderful, outstanding bathrooms, comfortable beds and plenty of windows to let in the sunshine.  Rooms also have a tea machine and plenty of herbal tea, coffee and hot chocolate for free.    The West India Quay locale is just perfect.…",None,5.0

Brand spanking new and sleek, it is a corporate hotel in a very corporate location, catering to corporate clients. The standard rooms are very nice and roomy with the standard Marriott amenities, but somehow they seem nicer than usual. The ""Executive"" rooms are the exact same as the standard rooms but they face the wharf. Great views...  The Exec Lounge is great, too. Hot buffet and cold buffet 2x a day is enough for b'fast and a small dinner which will save considerably in London. As a corporate traveler, I just loved this property and you will rack up the Marriott points with every stay! I would not recommend this hotel for leisure as it is way out of way and everything shuts up pretty early. ",None,5.0
