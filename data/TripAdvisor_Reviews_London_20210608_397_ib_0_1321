After selling the hotel and brand to her I have to say overall I’m disappointed with it.   Set in an excellent location we cannot complain on that front. The staff friendly and willing to help at any point are a credit to their company.  The downsides:  * room not cleaned for the duration of the weekend. Not sure if every hotel is taking this approach but it’s shocking. All they have to do is enter when the room is empty and follow guidance etc. But leaving a room to be used for a number of days without hoovering etc then you can imagine what it’s like when you have to eat your breakfast in there.  * said breakfast doesn’t include a hot option citing Covid regulations. The sister hotel Novotel (next door) offered full hot service last October so there is zero reasons to not offer this now. We’re out of all restrictions (fingers crossed) in 3 weeks so what are they going to do different? *contacted customer services for extra milk and the bags at 7pm and they didn’t arrive until 11pm - had to WhatsApp them as you’re not allowed to use the phones due to Covid.   Would I stay again? Yes if it was operating a more normal service, but if it continues as it is then no. It took the shine off our engagement weekend.   One last positive is that the free bottle of red and the rose petals for our engagement was a lovely touch - thank you!…",Date of stay: April 2021,2.0

Good value for London.,"We have used this hotel a few times now as it is very convenient for the Globe, and close to the Shard. Borough market round the corner and also close to underground.    Last year it had its refurb with the movie set theme which makes it a bit quirky and adds to its appeal.  The rooms are small but have everything you need and nice touches continuing the movie set theme.  Tea and coffee,usb chargers etc.  Also rooms are very clean and beds very comfortable. Breakfast was continental but all very good quality items.  Loved the virgin Mary shots and the guacamole, lovely fresh bread, fruit and homemade cake. Parking for us is another bonus.   Will be back again next year.",Date of stay: August 2019,5.0

We got exactly what we asked for.   We stayed one night on a Sunday and prices were very reasonable.   We had a room on street side and that's pretty noisy. But apart from that we only have good comments.   Room had what you need. Not luxurious (at that price...) but everything is there. Even USB power sockets. Which is great when travelling from Belgium.   Breakfast is fully self service but again everything you need was there. Quality is really good.   The location of the hotel is excellent.

It is a very average hotel and the only reason that they can keep charging such prices is their location. Nothing about the decor and ambiance was interesting but dull. The break fast and the service was even below average. But the lowest point for me was when I accidentally touched a menu that was placed in my room and my hand came off with some oily substance on it. It definitely did not smell nothing like food. I washed my hand straight away but could not shake the feeling for a while. The house keeping should be aware that we live in an era that a suspicious looking liquid can cause serous problems if touched and they should be more careful.,Date of stay: January 2015,3.0
