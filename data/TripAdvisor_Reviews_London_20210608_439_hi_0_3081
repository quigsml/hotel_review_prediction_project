Fantastic staff. Good rooms. Great Food.  Arrived at the hotel, it’s not the easiest front entrance to find but not really an issue.  Greeted at the front desk by Warren. What a professional man.

Ate lunch outside in the beer garden of the attached Irish bar. Food was nice. I can recommend the scotch egg!

However, yet again I had a problem with the way the hotel processes payments. I stayed there before and thought this was cleared but apparently not. The practice they follow is to preauthorise your stay but to charge again on checkout. I clearly explained this creates problems due to slow processing of preauthorisations and the reception duty manager said 'I see the preauthorisations, all is fine' . Guess what - the moment I went out of hotel they continued charging my card which got blocked by the issuer due to the repetitive suspicious transactions.

No heating in the room for the first 24 hours and then problems with hot water i.e. at times, there wasn’t any. Reception were apologetic when I complained but the problem wasn’t really fixed for the whole weekend.

Some days the room was cleaned, other days it was not. Not consistent. There are several Holiday Inns in short distance from each other and the staff are not very good at signposting so it is easy to get lost. There is no support for persons with communication disabilities and the staff do not seem trained. They also watch you and follow you around.

My wife and I stayed here recently and I couldn't fault this place. Staff are all fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. The room was a top floor interior and was clean, roomy, and silent. The hotel is close to the British museum, Kings Cross, a 15 min walk from the west end, and if it's raining, Russell Square station is across the road. Russell Square is connected direct to Heathrow for anyone flying in (takes about an hour). We will definitely be back. :-)  ",Date of stay: March 2016,5.0

When that was resolved, we had to make numerous payments, all on the same card, even though again it was one booking. We had been there half an hour at this point. Arriving at our rooms, we were greeted by all beds being doubles. We had booked all twins as a male party. Thankfully a change was offered immediately but then the room keys didn't work and had to be recharged. An hour to check in although to be fair we did receive a complimentary drink as an apology.

It's a well kept hotel which looks good inside and out. The standard rooms are adequate in size but no more. The executive rooms are much better with more space plus a couple of complimentary extras. One of the other bonuses is the number of nearby restaurants serving all tastes. One slight issue I have is breakfast. If paid for normally it's about £16 but reduced to £11.50 if vouchers are bought. This is a poor approach and far too expensive when compared to other hotels I have been in.
