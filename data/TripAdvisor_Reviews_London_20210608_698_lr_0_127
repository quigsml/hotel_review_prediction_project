The hotel may not be in the most salubrious of places but let's not forget it is in Bow and for me it was perfect. The young man on the desk was helpful and we were given an en-suite room to the rear. It was neat and clean and those bed sheets felt like silk. The shower room was narrow but functional and clean. Breakfast was included in the price which made this a very cheap deal. The breakfast room is down a narrow set of stairs and you just help yourself. I would suggest that this is not the ideal place to stay if you are physically disabled. I read on some of the reviews about a police station being opposite the hotel and hence being noisy. The police station is actually some way along the road and in our experience the siren noises were more to do with ambulances. I think it needs to be remembered, this is an inner city location and it is cheap. Close proximity to tube station means it could be used as a cheap option to explore London. Overall we were happy and would stay here again.…",Date of stay: November 2018,4.0

It was perfectly clean otherwise, a standard basic  small sized  room. Public transport is conveniently close by, as is a small supermarket. The breakfast/lounge area is somewhat peculiar.The staff is very friendly so all in all this has been a good stay in a cheap no frills hotel.",Date of stay: November 2009,3.0

The room was small – but not stiflingly so.  The bathroom was larger than some we’ve seen in our journeys throughout the UK and on the continent and the shower just missed winning the “best shower” award because it could have used a shower wand head rather than a fixed position nozzle – the water pressure and temperature was great though.  The bed was very comfortable and we even had enough plugs for our electronic equipment in the room – no easy task and one that most rooms fail.  The room was a bit hot even with the furnace off but we were happy to use the supplied fan to cool it down.  We were gone from very early to very late…,Date of stay: October 2009,5.0

The staff greeted us and were friendly and helpful and showed us round.  We had to pay upfront, but were able to look at the room first.  The room was very small, but we have stayed in smaller, and it was not too cramped.  The ensuite bathroom - toilet, washbasin, shower, wall cabinet, handwash and soap, one towel each, plenty of toilet rolls - was very clean.  As well as the bed, we had a bedside table, a lamp, an alarm clock (old style), a small table, a flatscreen TV on the wall, one chair, and free wifi.  Our room was on the ground floor.    Our room was clean and had all the basics.  Our only gripe is that the double bed was very narrow - too narrow for…",Date of stay: June 2009,3.0

Given the positive reviews and the photo on the website, we were expecting a simple, yet nice room. We were very disappointed that we got a small room in the basement. The wall above the window was mouldy, the walls were in bad condition because of persistent humidity, and the room had the typical smell of a basement. The small window opened to a stairway and a wall at about 1,5 meter distance, whith some pipes against it. The overall impression was quite depressing. Hotel rooms in a basement are just unconceivable to us. All the more so as there was no mention of such conditions on the website or of a difference in price for upper-level and underground rooms.  The ""double bed"" was so small that it was really not for two, and one…",Date of stay: September 2008,2.0

Located seconds away from train/bus, laundromat and groceries.  Very comfortable and clean room and excellent facilities including kitchen and lounge room and wireless internet access at no charge.

Good transport links to the West End, Canary Wharf, Docklands and Victoria Park and easy access to local amenities. We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and really enjoyed the hassle free comfortable atmosphere. Guests have access to the lobby and kitchen 24 hours to help themselves. Rooms are clean and nicely decorated. Real good value for money! We also hired a car from Enterprise, which is right across the road from the hotel.

I booked this accomodation, last minute as I drove down to London.  Since I was travelling alone I didnt want to pay an arm or a leg at other premium hotels! And to compound my problems it was the first friday of the school holidays.  So I managed to book and reserve a room here using my credit card by phone.  The staff were friendly, check-in was easy but despite providing my credit card details  to reserve my accomodation, I paid in cash and asked to scribble out my card details.  The stay was fine although a bit small. Rooms were clean, linen fresh. Bathrooms were shared, so not entirely 100% clean. Well it was just for a night so I would cope!  The stairways were narrow too, so managed to scrape my bag on the wall as I clambered up the stairs.  Parking was a…",Date of stay: July 2008,2.0

We booked into the City Stay Hotel 94 Bow Road Bromley and all our fears were put aside. This is a new hotel and therefore in peak condition - the common kitchen is fit for a chef. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms (a tad small) were clean, and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was also clinically clean. The only negative side is that it is over 1 hour to city centre but the hotel is on a good bus and tube link. (Tip buy a Bus day pass) you can bus hop all day - and get a good feel of London.       This hotel and staff exceeded our expectations and we would have no hesitation of booking in again. Good value with good clean…",Date of stay: June 2008,4.0
