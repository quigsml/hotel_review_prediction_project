Extremely filthy rooms, used towels, a bunch of hair on the floor and no body wash or shampoo. Layers of dust and insanely uncomfortable and small beds.  Rooms were tiny, a bit better on the top floor if you're ok with climbing five flights of narrow stairs. Ended up in the basement on the first nights which meant that the entire room vibrated as the underground passed by. Heating was unreliable and was turned off during the days.   Water stopped working on the third day which meant no toilet, shower or water for coffee and so on for the remainder of our stay. We were told to use the (really filthy) bathroom three floors down instead. Not really what you want for a couple's visit to London!   The entire hotel gave off a filthy vibe and the manager was unfriendly and talked to me as if I was a toddler. Treated my boyfriend better though. Other reception staff was friendly and helpful. Location is nice, but with several other hotels on the same street I'd recommend choosing anyone but this one... Avoid at all costs!!…",Date of stay: January 2020,1.0

Our room was very very small and every time the underground was passing everything was shaking in the room. The heater was on max and we couldn’t turn it down ourself, their solution was that they would turn it off in the entire hotel around 9 or 10 pm.  The last night we found out why the heater was on all the time......there were mold on the wall just next to the bed.  We asked for another room because of the mold, but their answer was that everything was occupied. I then asked them to book us into another hotel that they gave us another at the hotel, so that means that not all the rooms were occupied!

We did have a shock when we saw our room, Top floor very tired looking and no toilet or shower (not even on the same floor).Which i was informed was what i had booked, i had misread what was advertised, i assumed there was a shower and a shared WC (the toilet was 2 floors down)! All that said my girlfriend after being told there was no other rooms to upgrade to put up with it and would kill me later as not to ruin the weekend! The next day we did upgrade to a room with all facilities which was recently refurbished and was lovely and even the continental breakfast in the room was ok. We would defiantly book Tony's House Hotel again (a room with en-suite facilities).",Date of stay: September 2011,4.0

From the outside the hotel looks very good, however, once through the front door you realise that the place is in desperate need of a makeover.   We had a family room with 1 double and 3 single beds. The beds were very thin and the double was about the size of an average single bed. Behind 2 of the beds we found vermin boxes with poison in, and worryingly one where the poison had disappeared. However, the beds were comfy and all the bed linen and towels were clean.   Breakfast was delivered to outside the room at the time we asked for it. Breakfast is basically a tray of cartons of fruit juice, yoghurts, croissants, bred rolls, cheese and preserves. All in all breakfast was ok.

The staff was friendly, polite, and always enthusiastic to help us with everything we needed. The room we stayed at was rather not too spacious, because of the large and comfortable beds and our own private WC! This is indeed a rare sight in this London district. My son appreciated the free WiFi available, and the breakfast provided was not only ample, but also easy to carry around to quench our thirst or appetite while sight-seeing in London.
