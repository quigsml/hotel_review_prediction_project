You are expected to empty your own bins and collect fresh towels and toilet rolls from reception. No chance of fresh bed linen. Not great when it’s twenty five degrees outside so you need to take a shower more than once a day.  Using Covid as an excuse to reduce housekeeping services is just complete nonsense.,Date of stay: May 2021,1.0

We made special memories there as our daughter was growing up  This week we returned for what would probably be our last family holiday as our daughter is 17 and we wanted to have a great few days in the capital. The Novotel disappointed for the first time ever and this made us sad. When we arrived the car park was full and several spaces were taken with work vehicles. Reception couldn’t say when spaces might be free and so we were advised to park a good walk away in Greenwich. Fair enough but could be managed better in our view. The communal areas are tired with dirty and stained carpets and some gaps in joins. Our room was not clean and although I have photos I won’t post as it doesn’t help; but all door frames bed head and most hard services were thick with dust and there was no room cleaning during our stay with no bins emptied and food and detritus left for days in shared corridors from other guests.  Bathroom sink was dirty and the sink plug mechanism broken. There was no tea and coffee, no water, only 1 towel and no robes or slippers. We asked reception and no real reason was given. There were paper cups with tea and coffee at reception but just not the same. We stayed in another hotel days after and all these things were available so Covid is a key reason. Also at the other hotel the room was sealed and verified Covid clean. Nothing similar at the Novotel  At breakfast on the first morning we waited over 45 minutes for our food and after complaining we got the all too common current excuse that they were getting back up to speed after Covid restrictions. Not good enough sorry. I could go on but the bottom line is that as I said, it made us sad. We have some wonderful memories of our stays at the Novotel in Greenwich and this will be our last stay. We will return to London with our grand daughter in 2022 and will not be choosing the hotel. Shame. Just hope the hotel management get their act together or they will send others away unhappy.…",Date of stay: June 2021,3.0

Prices are somewhat lower than elsewhere in London so I took the opportunity to book a suite. That was quite nice, large room, bedroom and bathroom. Also no noise at all and that's rare in most hotels, but perhaps because I was on the top floor and no neighbors? Decoration is typical Novotel, it's pretty basic but that's fine with me. Good bed and happy to find a real shower cabin instead of standing in a lousy bathtub. Staff is friendly and helpful, like the other Novotels. Wifi is fast.

Free wifi in the lobby didn't work for me and I got rather annoyed as I was trying to watch the Olympics. Beds shockingly uncomfortable - thin, flimsy z-bed style mattresses on main double bed and camp beds for kids. You'd think they could put a decent mattress on the bed. Don't expect a comfortable sleep. No privacy in bathroom so don't share with friends if you are bashful or value your privacy while bathing and showering because there's a gap in the bathroom door that towels won't cover.

The reception staff are very competant and helpful and one in particular was very professional indeed. The rooms are modern and with plenty of space. The shower room seemed to be a bit close to the bed, but that is just being picky. Great buffet breakfast and probably worth the £14 if you have not booked B&B. The underground parking is very secure and good value at £10 over night. We didnt even have to pay any extra even though we left the car there for half of the next day whilst we toured around Greenwich. All in all a very good hotel very close to the village, DLR, Greenwich overground and the Thames clipper. Very much recommended.",Date of stay: October 2006,4.0

Breakfast OK but would recommend getting an inclusive package - if you have to pay the full price then there are options in Greenwich that might be better.

Not only is the building very comfortable to stay in, but the staff evidently enjoy working there, and it shows.  The service is so good that it's hard to believe that this is in London; I could even forgive the chambermaid walking in to the room as I was getting dressed, since she apologised so profusely.  The reception staff speak French as well as English.  Very good wine merchants just next door, and a basement car-park.  If they just got rid of the ashtrays from the bar this would be a five-star review. ",Date of stay: October 2006,4.0

So we wanted something close to the train station. To our surprise the Novotel was right next to the train platform, which initially worried me. Not an issue. Excellent soundproofing coupled with quiet A/C resulted in a no-noise visit.  Our room had a slightly odd layout, but the bed was so comfortable it was a shame to leave it early in the morning.  I'm afraid we had champagne at lunch. It would have been better to buy a bottle, but the impulse was easier since they have a nice selection by the glass.  Recommended.

The hotel itself is very modern, bright and clean.  Our room was quite typical for a business trip.  My only complaint about the room was the toilet which was seperate to the bathroom - it was very small and hard to get in and out of round the door, and i'm only 5ft and slim !!!

Great decision.  We booked the Novotel at their advance web rate of £89 B&B.

I opted not to have a replacement and received a phone call apologising and confirming our account had been corrected within 5 minutes.  Decor in the public areas is lovely and modern.

But am I glad that happened! The hotel is a typical new-style Novotel, decent rooms, good restaurant, modern public areas. And by the way, I actually like the fact that the toilet and bathroom are separate - it's hardly a long walk from one to the other. What makes this stand out is the service which is 5* star plus. It is welcoming, attentive but not obtrusive. The staff were polite to guests and EACH OTHER, which is something you rarely see.

It seems that Novotel has renovated most of their hotels and they are quite nice and modern. This hotel is only about one year old and you would not think that it even falls into a 3 star category. The bathrooms are very modern and super clean. The service is great and everything seems clean. As soon as you exit the metro you can see Novotel on your left which is very good for business travelers who are possibly working in Canary Wharf. I would highly recommenend it to any who wants to be easily connected to London and wants to stay in a nice hotel.

Toilets oddly placed away from bathrooms. Showers work properly (unusually for English hotels even today!) and bathrooms are well appointed. Ask for a room at the back and high up, they offer nice views over an old part of Greenwich. Front rooms are noisy from traffic especially at weekends from the busy pub next door. Fri and Sat evenings sometimes feature very bad pub singers in the restaurant so bring earplugs if ears are sensitive and you just want a quiet night.

The hotel opened in Spring 2005, so had a very new feel to it, which was nice.  It is clear that accountants and engineers, rather than decorators, have the upper hand on the design of Novotel's advertised New Generation hotel.  The rooms were pretty compact, with IKEA-type built-in furnishings.  In other words, corners were cut.  For example, the hallway from the entry door into the room was very narrow, which made luggage-handling unnecesarily tough.  The advertised ""sofa"" was really smaller than a love-seat.
