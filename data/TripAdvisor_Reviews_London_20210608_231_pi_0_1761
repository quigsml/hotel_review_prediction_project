All of the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I asked for a quiet table for breakfast as it does get very busy and they could not do enough to help us. After a day out sightseeing the bar was very clean and again the staff were lovely and helpful. A perfect way to end the day with a nice glass of wine.

We arrived at 3.30 pm and there was plenty of car parking space to the rear. The check in was quick and effortless. The rooms were all splendid and the beds really comfortable. We elected to pre book breakfast and it was very pleasant and everything was available and delivered to table.  The staff were wonderful and friendly. There was one horrible man who was abusive towards them for not opening the bar to provide him with a can of red bull. He was very bullying but the staff remained calm and dealt with him politely. He threatened to report them and we assured them that we thought they were polite and courteous despite his awful behaviour towards them.  The car park costs £12 per night and was easy to finalise. The stay cost us approx £100 per room for 2 nights and the tube station is outside the door. This is a perfect place to stay for leisure or business. It was clean, located well and had everything you could wish for.…",Date of stay: September 2020,5.0

I had an amazing two nights at the hotel for a business trip 2-4 June 2021.  The room was very fresh, very clean, spacious and offered all the facilities you need. Comfortable bed and pillows (free of neck and back pain!) - what every customer wishes for.   Two tube stations close by (Central and Piccadilly line) for an easy and short reach to central London.   Khalid was superb! On my second day, he made sure that I got what I asked for (extra coffee and tea). I found the staff at my door before I even arrived at the room. Definitely a 5 stars type of service - the kindest, most pleasant and friendly team!  Excellent welcoming upon arrival and a heartfelt goodbye upon departure.  Car park made life so much easier: I had no problem finding a space, even after I came back past 11 pm. Security was there to help 24/7.

The rooms are dated with a strong musty smell and not the cleanest I have ever stayed in.  I can’t comment on the food served in the restaurant as despite being a solo traveller and the restaurant being empty I was told I could not get a table for over an hour which even by the low expectations  I have for Premier Inn which is usually cheap and cheerful is pretty unacceptable.

The hotel is very easy to access from A40 into London. It means if travelling from the north you will hit minimal traffic into and out of London. The hotel is located next to hangar lane tube station on the central line and a short walk from park royal on the Piccadilly line. This is great if there are any problems on one of the lines as there were during our stay. We purchased visitor oyster cards and these were a doddle to use. The Piccadilly line visits most tourist areas such as Piccadilly circus and Covent garden. This was the line we used the most and was worth the short walk. The car park is a decent size and costs £7 per night. We arrived early and luckily checked in and parked the car. We were in central London by 10.30am!!!

I must explain that the profanity was included as part of a conversation between 2 staff members that unfortunately I overheard. The one with the foul mouth being the chef complaining to another staff member about the number of people booked in that he would have to cook for.

This is a very popular hotel and I think the staff try to do a good job under difficult conditions.  The bar area is way too small and typically has one member of staff trying to meet the demand from both the bar and restaurant,  which means waiting times are often excessive.  There are notices in the bar, reception restaurant advising guests to go eat somewhere else if they haven't booked. I've stayed there for four weeks whilst working in the area and so had a tendency to book, I have never seen the restaurant even close to capacity so I can only assume the volume is restricted because they cant get enough staff iin the kitchen.

Check this out.,"Having planned to spend a few days in London doing the tourist thing we decided to try Hanger Lane as a base, This choice was made after checking out the prices for a night stay in many areas in and around the London area.  Having booked and registered on line, we arrived at 10.30 am and reported to reception knowing check in was 2pm and asked if we could leave the car in the car park and go into the city by tube, and come back later. The staff were pleasant and obliging. The Hanger Lane tube station was right outside the front door, making the connection easy.  When we returned the automatic key issue machine was explained to us and indeed without  being asked a member of staff took our name and went through the procedure, asking the relevant questions.

This is quite decent by London standards.   However, if staying out after the Tube stations close (midnight), you will need to get a nightbus (or walk) to Trafalgar Square, then another to Ealing, where the stop is a 1.5 mile walk from the hotel still. Costs £7 in a taxi from the stop to the hotel. It took about 2 hours to get home from Camden, which isn't great. So if you are hitting London for nightlife, I do not recommend this hotel.
