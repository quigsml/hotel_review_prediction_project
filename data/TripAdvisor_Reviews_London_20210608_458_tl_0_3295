An often empty reception was the lowlight.’,"I stayed here for two nights during England’s COVID restrictions.  I applaud this hotel for taking many precautions to keep all of their guests as safe as possible during the pandemic.  They even, safely prepared takeaway breakfast bags for guests if required each morning.  These were advertised at £8.99 but did not appear on my bill, so either this was a gesture to my Platinum Loyalty status, or someone dropped a huge, bacon cob.  Like many IHG Hotels, I found my room tired and ‘old fashioned’ but spotlessly clean, which was reassuring.  In that situation, I wasn’t contemplating the wallpaper.   I did find that reception was often left unattended which in the COVID situation was a frustrating.  I waited ten minutes to check out due to an empty desk for instance, which was disappointing.  It’s location is a fair walk away from the bars and restaurants of Kings Cross, so do expect a trek if you’re visiting.   On balance, I would probably stay here again but only if visiting London on business, as it’s only a twenty minute walk to my company’s London office.…",Date of stay: April 2021,3.0

I am a IHG Platinum member so I did get a room upgrade but to say IHG have ‘clean guarantee’ policy is a joke. As you can see from then photos I had to call to reception and it’s took 3 attempts before they answered the phone, the desk chair had tomato ketchup and another stain on it.

We like the location.  Since our last visit the have lifted their game.  Asking for just a shower was not a problem.  Our room was on the 7th floor, the room was large as was the bathroom.  Luxurious towels provided.  1 bathrobe and scuffs.  The toiletries were an excellent quality.  This trip we opted for breakfast- a very good decision.  The breakfast was excellent.   The only fault is we were never greeted when walking in/ out the front doors.  We had to walk passed the reception desk to get to the lifts and still the staff never gave a friendly hello.

And I will say that the experience was somewhat negative. At the time I was an IHG Platinum Elite Member and was not recognised nor was I given an upgrade. What I found also infuriating was the fact that the spa was advertised for free use by guests on the IHG website. Yet when we actually got there we were charged a fee to use the jacuzzi and sauna. Quite ridiculous.  They did allow my daughter to eat breakfast for free....but that was about it.  Won't be staying here again in the near future.

We'd booked a family room for 4. 2 towels, 1 bottle of water etc. And the beds were so small that my sister & I barely slept - probably OK if you're a couple who snuggle - but we don't generally(!), so felt as if we were perching on the edge of the mattress all night.

I boooked a standard room and given an 'upgrade' to a Club room as I'm a member but it was really small room with no Nespresso which Ive come to expect in a club room.

The location of hotel is ok, about 10 minute walk to kings cross station where the subway can be accessed.  The room itself was spacious for the four of us however the air con is pretty bad and the toilet had a horrible smell in it. This may have something to do with the vent at the side of the toilet which I can only assume is meant to take the sewage smell away from the building. As for the air con, it's pointless if no cold air comes out. The only other issue would be the fact that guest must pay for use of the hotels leisure facilities. Apart from these minor problems the stay was fine, wouldn't class it as four star as premier inn and travelogue hotels are better.",Date of stay: July 2017,3.0

Not 4 stars,"Stayed here with my husband and 2 kids.  We visited during the refurbishment, we weren't made aware of this at the time of booking. We stayed on the floor being refurbished so Access to our room was limited. We couldn't use the stairs and there was only 1 lift to our floor. It meant long waits at the lift and took us ages to get anywhere.  Breakfast and gym use was extra cost. We paid to use the swimming pool and the changing rooms were completely flooded.  The pool was lovely but a bit small given the size of the hotel. It was very busy as a result.  Good gym facilities.  Our room was a bit tired and dated (hence the refurb) unfortunately our beds were not great. Very old and It was like sleeping on a trampoline.

The hotel is a little dated and needs a lick of paint but the breakfast is generally good. The mattresses are soft and feel like they need updating too.  The positives to this hotel are its great location to Kings Cross and the West End. It's not near to any tube but it's a 15 minute walk from kings cross and 30 minutes into the heart of Covent Garden.   Also, it has a pool which many central London hotels don't have so it's great for a family break.

Room was comfortable and clean.  Stayed on a Thursday night.  Didn't hear any noise.  Breakfast was OK.  Not brilliant but had all the basics.  Was a little put off by the breakfast manager who 'waved' me over to my table from the other end of the dining area which was a bit odd.  Wasn't even sure he was waving at me at first - who does that?  Glad it was only one night.  Wouldn't wish to stay here again.  It did not feel like a treat.

Comfortable enough rooms and decent sound proofing from external traffic etc. as usual the noise from other hotel users isn't quite as well controlled. Breakfast in our package was the continental and not that interesting really. Drinks reasonably priced. Not a bad location for an abundance of pubs/eating places nearby. It's a good 15-20 min walk to any of the tube stations although hundreds of buses and taxis right outside the hotel. The Union Tavern across the road was a good watering hole whilst staying here.

The poor experience started off in reception, where the one person on duty able to check me in expected me to wait while she finished  entering some admin stuff into her computer.   The bedroom is decorated in dull shades of brown, creating a very gloomy atmosphere. The decor doesn't appear to have been updated for some time, although at least the bedding has been updated tro include duvets. The bathroom too is sadly in need of redecoration and the thin, tiny towels a joke.  There is a gym, it costs £3.50 per day.

Our cabby took advantage of our American accents and took us the long way.  14 pounds for the trip.  Whereas our British friends who met us at the station and took a different cab to the same hotel but left in the cab right AFTER ours got there before us and for only 7 pounds.

The sofa bed was horrible, only my son who is 4 yrs old was able to actually sleep on it, but it would have broken easily with an average weight adult.

They responded with the offer of a free weekend stay which, in fairness, was reasonable. I took them up on that offer, had only one meal in the hotel and didn't get room service.

I believe it was about 55.00 British  pounds per night which was very good compared to other quotes for a family of four. Having  arrived at the hotel  around noon there was quite a lengthy wait for our room. If I remember it took until around 4pm before we could get in.

The room and bed size are big as compared to London standard, we got 2 double beds in the room with room to spare. What we are not really happy with is their overpriced English breakfast. We don't understand why it only includes 2 English breakfast when we booked a triple room. Therefore, we had to pay 12.50GBP for an additional English breakfast. The breakfast is good if you it's included in your package, otherwise it's not really worth paying 12.50GBP for it.
