A great location. We recently stayed 2 nights here and can only speak highly of the Hotel. All the staff were really nice and friendly. We had a lovely welcome. It was great to see staff smiling. Our room was a decent size. The beds were comfy and the bathroom was also a good size. The Breakfast was superb. Loads of choice and really tasty. Everything is table service now but nothing was to much trouble. The ladies serving us were very helpful.  I think the Manager was named Fernando and he was also really friendly and helpful. We'd definitely visit again. ,Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

I rang the buzzer on first arriving and the lift took me to reception on the second floor- friendly efficient check in (request for room with bath and view of the Square to ‚ÄúJo‚Äù granted!) and lovely room which turned out to be triple glazed (so no noise but needed a clean from the outside) with views of London Eye, Nelson‚Äôs Column etc. comfy bed, desk and tea/coffee. as my stay was during lockdown the restaurant wasn‚Äôt open but half of Chinatown‚Äôs were so I just popped out around 7pm each night and chose my meal to take back to the room (I even used the McDonalds app to order from the restaurant across the Square, put my coat on, walked over there and it was waiting for me when I arrived!).

For us though - the hotel fell far short of our expectations (that are based on lots of Premier Inn stays). The bed was rickety, creaky and hard - even with a mattress topper. The pillows lumpy and hard - even the ones offered additionally, i.e. in that storage unit. Bedlinen tired. So, not great at all. The hotel geneally looks knackered. COVID meant we were table served breakfast, but they didn't have enough staff so it was slow and the food not held well - the hope with a cook-order offering is that there's a chance of more freshly-prepared produce but sadly the eggs were hard and rubbery,‚Ä¶",Date of stay: May 2021,3.0

The best part of the hotel have to be the staff. They were chatty, helpful, welcoming and friendly. Most importantly - there was absolutely no noise or disruption from nearby Leicester Square.

The best part about the hotel was its excellent location! It is just 2 mins walk to the Leicester Square underground and also nearby places of interest such as Trafalgar Square. There are many eateries and shops in the area as well!  The only problem we faced was that the cab we came in from the airport to the hotel could not be brought near the entrance to the hotel as vehicles are not allowed in that area.

The room was a double and very small, but you are warned of this on the website so you have been warned. It was fine for me as I was on my own but I think the wardrobe facilities and space around the bed would have been inadequate for two people for more than one night. The window was triple glazed so I had no outside noise at all. The downside to that was the window could not be opened, however there was an air conditioning unit in the room which I was aware of as it was mentioned in the description online. The unit was a bit noisy, as they are, and was a bit awkward to get the temperature I wanted, but not a major issue.

Several key points to share with you: Location is great, just 3 min walk away from the tube. for a first comer to London, this is very a benefit. Also, it is 1 min walk from Chinatown. However, except Location, nothing I can comment positively:  I was told that it is a rule in this hotel that the shower water can only be kept at 37C degree. This is  killing me in the freezingly cold later Nov in London.  The layout and decoration of this hotel are stunningly poor, it is like a two star hotel, very shabby.  almost no service.

I saw the premier inn in Leicester square and called in on the off chance to see if we could leave bags. The staff couldn't do enough for us and agreed straight away. Then when we collected them later they gave us water and a complimentary glass of wine each that had been poured in error for a guest of theirs and would go to waste. We were totally bowled over.

It was my first time in a Premier Inn and I chose it for the proximity to a flat I was helping move out of.   The location is amazing, just off Leicester Square and down the road from Prince Charles Theatre, 99 pounds a night! The room is spacious, well equipped and I really liked the decently sized bathroom with walk-in shower. Everything was spotless, TV worked well, Tea-making facilities and supplies renewed daily. Great bed, lovely towels, good pressure in the shower. Feels really safe as room cards are needed to access floors and corridors and I heard no outside noise. Welcome and check-in was friendly and quick. Any help I requested at the front-desk was dealt with immediately and professionally. Lovely personnel.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2013,5.0
