Staff on reception ( I think we encountered 3 or 4) were lovely and made a real effort with my children.  Good location.   Hotel room v quiet (apart from the trains outside but we can hardly blame that on the hotel and train spotting kept the kids entertained!).

Yes, there was a sign in the room but I didn’t read it, as it was about 9pm, I was tired and and I just presumed it was a usual ‘do not disturb’ sign present in all hotels. My advice is that your reception staff mention this at check in when people are staying more than one night, as this certainly isn’t standard practice.

The receptionist was very nice and told us everything we needed to know. The room was large enough for the 4 of us and we had a quiet room.

We (husband and I) stayed at the Travelodge Southwark for the 1 night for pleasure/business purposes. We were greeted with a lovely smile and service by Doris who we can not rate highly enough. She was fun, she joked and nothing was too much trouble and made our stay very enjoyable. Located in a fab location, only a 2 min walk from the tube station, surrounded by nice pubs (for food and drink) and to top it off, we were allocated a city view room which was gorgeous in the evening.

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  The reception staff was OUTSTANDING - particularly Doris, who was most helpful in helping us get oriented in town.  She also made great suggestions about where to eat and how to get around (which was quite necessary, as London is currently ""under construction"" - not the city we visited 10 years ago for certain).  Actually, the only ""negative"" was that our in-room coffee supply was never actually replenished after the first day.  Perhaps an oversight and perfectly ""forgivable""  Overall, a near perfect stay and would highly recommend to anyone wishing to stay in London/Southwark without ""breaking the bank"".",Date of stay: July 2017,5.0

Sorry to say it was a miserable experience throughout.   Night one saw us in a room on the 6th floor - the Business Floor, which is not different from any other floor it seems.  The rooms whilst seemingly reasonable are poorly appointed and badly fitted out.  This one had a broken desk, missing bits from the bath taps and curtains that were 2"" different in length.  The windows were dirty and the carpet didn't appear to have been hoovered.   However, the bed was clean and so off to sleep we went - only to be awoken at 03:30 by the aircon making a load of noise.

When opening the door we were greeted with the remains of how a previous guest had left the room. The beds had not been made or the cleaning hadn't clearly been done. As the room was clearly unacceptable we went to reception to complain and we were greeted by a grumpy young guy who clearly wasn't bothered and didn't apologise or anything! Once we had been allocated another room its was a lovely room and overall the stay was very pleasant. It was quiet and peaceful at night and no hassle. It's a good location just a bit far away from the likes of the strand and west end!,Date of stay: May 2013,4.0

We thought that all of the staff were very helpful and polite and they made our short break all the more enjoyable.

Check out was 12 noon, but our train was not until 9.30 that night so they held our bags in a secure room for us until we were ready to collect them.  They didn't just put them in a room, they tagged them also with a security code which we thought was brilliant.
