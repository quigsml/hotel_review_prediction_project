On arrival we were met by ""Isabelle"" who I can only assume is new to the world of customer services and dealing with people.  We were advised that check in was not to later so we were advised to leave our bags in the staff cloakroom.  Our luggage contained some quite expensive items and we were provided with a post-it note on our luggage with my first name on it.
