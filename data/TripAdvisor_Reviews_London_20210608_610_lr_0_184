Very disappointed in Alfred and the team at Gower Hotel.  Understandable about a two star rating.  The only redeeming spot is a reduced price for a multi-day trip in the future, which will not be possible for my family of 10.  Very poor business practice in a time when future travelers with less funding will make future travel decisions.  No doubt another business that will likely not survive COVID crisis.

It looked OK until I went into bathroom and luckily before I sat on toilet saw that it was covered in dried urine. The dour receptionist quickly offered me a room at the Athena (an upgrade) which had no hot water. The staff let us shower in a room across the hall. It seems staff is used to these situations so has ""plan B"" ready as alternatives.",Date of stay: March 2008,1.0

Our first night was spent in one of rooms closest to the main road.  It was a bit noisy as had to have to window open for air.  However the hotel kindly moved us to the rear of the building when a room came available.  It is a basic hotel but clean and friendly. The proximity to the Paddington tube line is fantastic.  We would stay there again. ,Date of stay: June 2007,3.0

However, I just received an e mail cancelling my booking, apparently because my cards details were unvalid. The hotel pretends to have e mailed me last week end in order for me to confirm my banking details but I never received any e mail from them. They had the right e mail address because when i asked them to confirm my booking two weeks ago they replied to me using the right address.  Now I have received their mail 2 days before my trip. I rang them to  confirm my bank details but the hotel told me that it was too late and that the hotel was fully booked now.  They were obviously overbooked and had to cancel some of their booking.

And that was pretty bad for a supposed 3 star hotel, so Lord alone knows what the 2 star Gower was like to stay in. The very brief period we were standing at the hatch which seems to act as a reception in the hotel, gave us a pretty bad impression as did the very unfriendly receptionist.

This would be the worst place we have stayed in by far, the rooms are dirty and dusty, every time my kids moved the bed spread we all started sneezing from the dust and the musty smell was terrable, these rooms havent been touched in 20 years.

The staff, and particularly the Manager, were pleasant and helpful.  Room and en-suite were clean, although decor & furniture is dated, the tea/coffee-making facilities were most welcome.  Breakfast was adequate (not very exciting).

Further to the terrorist attacks of 7th July, the public were advised not to travel to London at that time.  The Gower Hotel operates a 72 hour cancellation policy, and whilst I fully understand their need for such a policy, I was surprised that they showed no leniency with regards to its operation given the circumstances.  When I spoke with both DiscountCityHotels and the Gower Hotel on 7th and 8th July, I was told by both that London was fully open for business (despite conflicting advice on the news....), and that the cancellation policy (ie. charging full room rate for any room cancelled within 72 hours of arrival) would still hold.

Good eating close at hand, I had Fish and Chips and my niece had Kentucky Fried Chicken! We didn't need to eat out much as the English breakfast provided by the Hotel was very sufficient and good tasting.

I found more cockroaches underneath my suitcase. I complained, but they were not willing to give me a different room.
