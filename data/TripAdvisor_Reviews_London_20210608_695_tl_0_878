Staff and guests do, of course, have to wear the pointless muzzles which are imposed on all of us.   Breakfast is provided by means of a breakfast box which had been booked for me by work, but the hotel had no record of it. However in the light of the appalling lockdown which is destroying our national economy I think that’s really the least of anyone’s problems right now.  The team were immensely friendly and helpful, and I pay tribute to the way they are coping in these very difficult circumstances.  There was a problem with the shower controls and with a noisy air-conditioning unit. I don’t blame the hotel at all for this: I’m certain other guests have noticed, but if you don’t tell the hotel they don’t know.  Telepathy is in pretty short supply nowadays. So please do everyone a favour and let them know at the front desk when you check out if there’s anything they need to sort in the room.  …",Date of stay: March 2021,5.0

A friendly greeting and quick check in. Our room (210) was not on the railway side so not noisy but I imagine the odd numbered rooms would be much noisier. The room was a decent size brightly decorated and furnished and the bed was comfortable.  There was a small shower room (no shower gel in the dispenser in the shower should have been attended to before our stay) which was also bright and simple.  Perhaps the only criticism of he room was there were no reading lights by the bed but for a one night business stay it did not matter.  The breakfast/dining room is not currently operational - probably not economical to do so at the moment but there are other options nearby.  One cannot expect luxury at Travelodge but for the location and room we felt this was excellent value for money (we have stayed in far worse places for much more money many times) and if we need to stay in this vicinity again we would certainly come back.…,Date of stay: September 2020,4.0

It was 32 degrees C outside on London and as we waked into reception we commented on how hot the inside of the hotel was. The friendly receptionist advised that Travelodge had bought this hotel and found that the air conditioning system was supplied by a company who were no longer in existence so they couldn't get any spare parts - hence no air conditioning in the hotel. She warned us to keep our windows and curtains closed because they had experimented and found that the temperature was lower this way. That set the alarm bells ringing and we headed up to our room.

Thought we had made a mistake when we saw how close it was to the railway tracks but found with the windows closed we slept very well and the fans provided in the room helped as it was quite warm.
