We were allowed to leave our luggage, free of charge, for several hours, on the day of departure. The staff even allowed us to utilise their kitchen facilities to heat up tea on our first night.  The rooms were serviced daily with clean towels.  The breakfast was simple but fresh and filling (corn flakes, toast, coffee/tea, juice) and tastier than that of the Travelodge!  I travel to London frequently and had the benefit to visit all potential hotels for our stay.    I visited Paddington, Victoria, Earls Court, Kennsington, Kings Cross & most of the inner city Travelodges.  I chose the Sara Hotel because it…",Date of stay: September 2008,5.0

So we really only slept and changed clothes here! Good thing really as the hotel was awful I think staying in a skip would have been cleaner  We arrived and were told our room was in the basement, we got in and found in case of fire we would have break a window!  The room was dirty, shabby, and tiny,  the bed was so wobbly that every time my partner rolled over he woke me up. He almost slept on the floor but didn't cos the dirt.   My watch fell under the bed and when I retrieved it I was shocked to see that the carpet was under a thick layer of dust   We didn't dare use the shower it was filthy, smelt, no water pressure and had mildew on the walls, and shower curtain.

We needed cheap accomodation in central London. The location is excellent, less than a minute from the underground station. Upon check in, the staff were friendly and helpful, answering all my questions about travelling in London cheaply.  The room was clean and adequate for our purposes and reflected the price we paid.

Our twin room was small and the furnature old and a bit tired. The bed linen and  towels were old but clean enough, the shower room was the same, clean enough but old. The staff were friendly and helpful. For a very cheap hotel in London, being very close to the train/tube station it is perfect for short stays, especially if spending long days out touring around or as we were doing just the one night in London for a concert in Hyde Park. I feel we got what we paid for, value for money.   Altogether a pretty good experience. Pay by cash as there is a surcharge for credit cards, but it is given in the information when you book.",Date of stay: June 2008,4.0

I booked 2 double rooms and one of them had the dimensions to be consider a double one. Rooms were filthy, full of dust, stinky of smoke of previous guests (the color of he curtains was grey while the original one should be white!). My room was the horrible number 4 (almost underground!). There was no place on the ground where to leave our luggages and so no the possibility to exit from the room in case of immediate necessity.  The moquette had many signs of sigarettes (holes) and there were also pieces of nails of unknown origin. The bathroom did no have any heating, but was full of rust (could be dangerous for people with children!).

My husband, my father, my aunt and I booked this hotel through the internet, looking at the pictures on the net they didn't look too bad. We booked two single rooms and a double. After driving a very long 6 hours from holyhead we arrived at 5 in the morning. We were told ""Your room is up there, number 7"". We struggled up the narrow stairs with our luggage. The smell in the room was of mould, old tobacco and dried urine. They had orange stripy, stained material on the floor instead of carpet. The walls were covered in dirty pink wallpaper with lots of holes filled in with unpainted polyfiller. We pulled back the throwover on the bed to reveal dirty brown stains on the sheets and throw.

One does have to expect small, somewhat moldy rooms for this price, and at least the rooms are ensuite and the location central.  Even though I e-mailed with them several times, though, they did not have my reservation and tried to make me pay a higher price since all they had available was a double.  Everything else was pretty passable--again, you can't expect much more for the price.  It's worth it to look around for something a little nicer, though. ",None,2.0
