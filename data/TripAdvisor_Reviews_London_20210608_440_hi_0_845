Great value for money hotel with breakfast included in the price. And what a great breakfast it was. Bacon, sausage, egg, beans, tomatoes, hash browns, toast, cereals, fruit, muffins, coffee/tea, orange juice etc. Beds were comfortable & clean. Shower was powerful and hot, Staff were pleasant and helpful. Situated about 9 minutes  away from DLR Station (we are slow walkers), and a great choice of restaurants & takeaways within walking distance. Speedy elevator to all floors. Not much of a view from the windows,  but so what ! Overall a great value for money hotel. Would definitely stay there again.",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

2,/Hotel_Review-g186338-d289182-Reviews-or0-Holiday_Inn_Express_London_Limehouse-London_England.html#REVIEWS,Holiday Inn Express London-Limehouse Hotel Reviews,Gem of a property,"If you don't mind me fractionally outside of central London, you cannot go wrong with this real gem of a hotel. Very friendly, helpful (multi lingual) staff in a really great location, makes it an excellent spot for visiting or working in London especially in the challenging COVID era. It's very close to the Limehouse DLR stop, which is two stops from the Bank underground station. Or you can connect with the Jubilee Line in other directions. It's actually only about a 20 minute walk to Tower Bridge if you feel energetic. They also have parking on site.  You'll get the full, regular Holiday Inn experience, even in the midst of the COVID crisis. They are operating safe, COVID practices, yet everything is almost as normal, something that clearly proves all the other hotels placing daft restrictions on their services are simply using the crisis to offer less. Masks are compulsory in all public areas for staff and guests alike. Rooms are disinfected in between guests. The bar is closed, the lounge is closed, but that's all COVID compliant.  First of all, the rates are incredibly low during the crisis. They're running about 1/3 of the normal price. Yet you get more-or-less everything the hotel would normally offer. Sure, it's quite a basic property, but nonetheless very comfortable and clean. They could do with a refresh, but they're well maintained. Basic rooms, but with ample space for luggage and clothes, an iron, ironing board, hairdryer, kettle, tea & coffee, flat screen TV, cable channels, free reliable WIFI, desk, seating, black out curtains, very good heating, clean, fresh linens. For what's on offer for what they're currently charging, it's close to a 5 star experience in terms of value.  Bathrooms are small, with only shower stalls, but they're clean and the hot water pressure is excellent. Towels are clean and fresh. Like almost every property currently open anywhere, they are not providing daily house keeping, but all you have to do is ask and they will service your room and you can get clean towels any time.  What makes this property stand out particularly is that breakfast is included in the rate and they are offering FULL breakfast. Proving once again that all those hotels just handing you a bag of packaged pastries are just cutting corners because they want to. The HIE Limehouse is offering two buffet lines of food, served to you under strict COVID rules. All the normal hot food is available, but it is covered and served to you by one staff member, who packages it for you to take to your room. Or you can have cold buffet - cereals, fruits, yogurt etc - all pre-sealed. You help yourself to those and again, take them back to your room. Full self serve coffee is also available. The hot breakfast includes bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns, beans, toast, tomatoes. If they can do it, fully COVID compliant, so can everyone else. This for me gives this property 13 out of 10 stars.  It's only fair to record that I did have some issues with the room on check in, but the staff immediately rectified the problems with no delays. Don't be afraid to ask if there's a problem. Just because of COVID, you don't have to put up with room issues. Again, this hotel proves that.  There is some room to room noise for sure. But this is a 3 star rated property, so that's more than likely. It wasn't particularly terrible other than one guest who was only there one night. I guess she  was just an insomniac who likes shouting at a TV on full blast. Badly behaved guests aren't the hotels fault, but sound proofing is weak here.  I come to London for business often and I will be seeking out his hotel always in the future. After the COVID crisis ends, it probably won't be such an affordable option, but they've earned the loyalty of all their guests through their 'can do' attitude compared to the 'can't and won't do' excuses laid on by a lot of their higher priced and higher rated competition in London during this crisis. The staff alone make this property a very friendly experience. They're great people.…",Date of stay: January 2021,5.0

Room was clean and had all the essentials you'd need. The T.V. was a tad small but still worked fine. Staff were friendly and had no issues with the room or the hotel. Beds were comfy and the showers worked fine. I was surprised with the free wi-fi. So many hotels Ive been to chrge you for wi-fi and it has terrible range to the point of being useless, but that's not the case. It worked pretty well for what it was to the point of streaming football on a iPhone without any issues.

The room was cramped, one double bed and a sofa bed which was far too small for our 10 year old and 7 year old to sleep on. The “all you can eat breakfast” was a bag with one either bacon, sausage or vegetarian sandwich, a croissant and a piece of fruit. You could add drinks, a muffin and a yoghurt to it but come on that is not an all you can eat continental breakfast? I get things have had to change with COVID around but I’m sure there would have been a better way to offer the breakfast.

No wonder, it is a car repair and preparation shop next door. The receptions response to my complaint about it was ""I will look into it"" and in practice ignored. When reported after returning from the city that it was still there the response was ""housekeeping said it was ok, it was a cleaning agent used in the hallway"".

It is kinda hard to get there from Heathrow, especially on the non-express train as it took 90 mins on normal service to get to Tower station then we gave up and caught a cab. It is easy enough to find from the station and is in a fairly good location. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget. The breakfast that was included was pretty good. Overall a great stay.

The room was functionalable yet the air con in the room only seemed to heat the room, I like a nice cool room so I can snuggle into the quilt yet the room was around 24C all night long which is a bit warm for me. The only other way to get the room cool is to open the window and then the noise from the road is awful.

I looked at several hotels in London and most had poor reviews. Holiday Inn Express at Limehouse had good reviews so we decided to book a room there. The room was only 58 GBP for a twin when using the advance reservation. I had to pay in full right then and there and it was not refundable. If you are sure your plans won't change, this was a great deal. The room was large (By London standards) with a nice size bathroom (again by London Standards). The room was clean as was the hotel.

Good location for the low price we paid - only few minutes walk from the nearest DLR station (which connects easily to the tube) Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are typical chain hotel style and very comortable. We stayed in rooms at the back of the hotel and experienced no traffic noise.  Only downside would be distance into the City, easily walked if you have the time and energy, but do need to use the DLR/tube for speed and ease.

I only paid 53 GBP per night because I prepaid for the stay on Holiday Inn's website.  My room was on the 5th floor and had a double bed and a sofa bed.  The room was very clean and handsomely decorated.  It's a bit small compared to North American standards but normal for Europe and just large enough for 3 people.  The sofa bed actually turned out to be quite comfortable.  I had a room facing the street and while I could hear the traffic during the day, it was never loud enough to disturb my sleep.

Firstly there was one major criticism, and that’s the staff. Granted I think I saw the reception staff twice during my stay there as we didn’t have breakfast either day but on the day of arriving the reception sent us to the wrong room – without setting up the key cards properly also. So anyway after messing about for 20 minutes we finally got into the room to find someone else was in it! To say he was shocked was an under-statement. Well a little conversation with the reception again and this was sorted.
