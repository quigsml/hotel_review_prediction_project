I did however enjoy my stay and for the budget traveler who understands that they are not staying at the Ritz I would definitely recommend this hotel.  I would stay here again, it beats a 16 bed hostel!!! ",Date of stay: March 2005,3.0

I payed 30 pounds for a single room and received a triple room at no extra cost. The room was tight, but clean, and the bathroom was your standard tiny European bathroom. The staff were friendly enough, and the location was superb for sightseeing.",None,4.0

Staff are nice, but our room was antiquated. The bunk beds had graffitti all over them. The en-suite was a pre-fabricated 3' square self contained unit. When you had a shower the entire inside of the en-suite was showered too. The smell that emanated into the bedroom was awful. We didn't eat here so can't comment on the food. At least it was centrally located. Great shops nearby. ",None,1.0

I stayed there for 3 nights in november I don't recommend you the last floor, it's an odissey to get there, you end up breathless...!I was very unlucky because my bathroom contentrated all the nasty smells of the building. Nice staff, horrible breakfast (pls, have breakfast somewhere else...), but not all is bad...: very well located, closed to shops, cinemas, post office, underground station. ",None,3.0

It was OK , clean and central, the street was a bit noisy, the staff were OK, not very friendly.  If you get sent to the annexe buidling make sure you don't have heavy cases to lift up the flights of stairs as we did, (no lifts). Just OK for the money i suppose. ",Date of stay: May 2004,2.0

It was pretty much what I expected; it wasn't expensive (for a single room 63 euros/night), I slept well, had my own privacy, breakfast was modest but ok for a student who is not too picky and my room also had wc and shower. (For a Finn used to triple glass windows the draft and street noise through single glass window was a bit annoying. Luckily it was summer...)  Since I wanted cheap accommodation but wasn't willing to stay in a youth hostel, Lords Hotel filled my expectations. For someone used to luxury it's definitely a wrong choice.  ",None,2.0

But the building needs a quick makeover, because the paint is blattering, the beds are small (for Western Europeans) and the bathroom is too tiny for a washing-smurf. But in a positive view, the staff is pretty friendly and the price is okay. Expect not too much and you will take the hotelquality for granted and will enjoy the best city in the world!",None,2.0
