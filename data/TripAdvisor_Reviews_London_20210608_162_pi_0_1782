The shower cubicle was the smallest I have ever used  which meant I had to stand upright and limit movement whilst washing and I am a petite adult.

When we first arrived, there had been a double booking for our room, so we were upgraded to a larger one. Unfortunately, due to some artisan work going on at that same floor there and then, the smell of thinner was unbearable in the room. Mr Milagris said twice that if we were not satisfied we would get another room. Since we were tired and needed to rest after our trip, we couldn't stay in that room at all. He then offered us an even better room where we could stay throughout our 3 day stay, and we couldn't have been more happy than with that room!

I think some of the previous reviews are pretty harsh to be honest.  The hotel is in a nice Square within Bayswater, a short distance from a number of tube stations.  The rooms are not huge, but they are very pleasant..  We stayed here two nights but in the day we were out doing tourism.  This hotel was ideal as the location is pretty good, the price was quite good value and the rooms were cosy.  For another tourism trip to London I would happily stay there again.  That said, if you are looking for a longer stay then perhaps the room size will bother you.  For 2 days though, not a problem at all!!",Date of stay: February 2010,4.0

My room overlooked the street and a lovely communal garden.  The hotel is easy to locate and only a short walk from the tube in a nice area. I would recommend it as very good quality for the price and would definitely stay there again.",Date of stay: March 2008,3.0

The property has been completely revamped.  Of course the rooms are small, but that's what you will find in London and most of Europe.    A room with any floor space is going to cost you high dollar in a hotel catering mostly to wealthy Americans who are used to wide open spaces. Clean, pleasant and quite nice.  Neighborhood is quiet and easy to catch a bus or a pleasant walk to the Underground.  Shopping Mall two blocks away with Internet Cafe and Starbucks. I expected some problems arriving on ""opening day"" but glitches were quickly worked out. I never made it down to breakfast.  Hotel is supposed to have a bar and restaurant, but it had not been opened yet.  ‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2008,4.0
