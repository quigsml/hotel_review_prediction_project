Upon arrival I instantly noticed how dirty the reception area was, the floors were covered in dirt, crumbs and shoe prints. The man on reception told us our room was number 4, in the basement which we weren’t too pleased about as we asked to not be put there specifically. We went down to our room, upon arriving in the “shared kitchen” it was filthy, food on the sides and a bowl of beans left by the kettle.   Once we entered our room we instantly noticed how unhygienic it was, the bed sheets had stains on and when we lifted the duvet there were hairs in the bed. The floor was sticky, the doors filthy and had hand prints all over, the shower was full of limescale and the spinning desk chair that they provided in the room was covered in dirty stains. I went straight into the reception to ask if any other rooms were available to see which we were told no as they were “fully booked” I explained the cleanliness issues with our room and the receptionist insisted on looking himself, he tried to telll us this room was “lovely and clean and very nice” I can assure you it was not.   We asked for a refund as we did not want to stay here and booked the holiday inn down the road from here for the three nights, we were told this wasn’t possible even though we had only spent no more than 10 minutes in it. I’m disgusted at the fact they advertise to be a clean hotel when it is not at all.   I would recommend you don’t even consider staying at this hotel as there cleaning standards are not acceptable at all!…",Date of stay: May 2021,1.0

The nutcase banged and banged on my door in the middle of the night and when I wouldn't open it, he kicked it down so it was hanging off the springs all because the Night Porter wasn't doing his job properly in keeping the building safe when I had asked him not to let this guy back in.  I screamed when he kicked the door down because I was so scared and this upset everyone in the hotel and all the guests who went to Reception the next day and demanded full refund.   Why did the Night Porter let the guy back in and go upstairs when I asked him not to let him in? He wasn't doing his job properly as the Night Porter and that's not safe.   Why wasn't there a hotel phone in the room so I could call Reception on 0 when the guy was banging and ask him to come upstairs? That's not safe.   Why wasn't the address of the hotel written anywhere in the room so I could call 999 when the guy was banging and tell the police the address to come to? That's not safe.   Why was the window able to open wide open when I was on the 4th floor and the window right next to the door, that's not safe.

Our triple room had two beds and our own bathroom. The bathroom was super tiny- literally 3 feet wide by 6 feet long or thereabouts.  Breakfast was provided- nothing fancy but sufficient to fill us up for our sightseeing adventures.  Flat screen tv with cable and free WiFi were included in the room price. Overall, this is a sufficient place to stay for a couple nights- however, I wouldn't spend too much money on it- even though it is London. I feel if you booked in advance you could probably get a more spacious room for the same price somewhere else. ",Date of stay: April 2014,3.0

We were extremely disappointed with the room which had a double bed in one corner of the room and a single bed next to it with about a 15cm gap between them. The room was unbelieveably small, and would've been even if there was just a double bed in there! Due to the size of the room there was nothing else in the room apart from three hooks on the wall, so there is no where to put your things!
