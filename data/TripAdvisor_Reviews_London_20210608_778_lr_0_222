We appreciate the strategic location as we are always on the go. There are many bus stations just around the corner and two tube stations with different lines. Also, full English breakfast is served on the table freshly cooked. But the dining room is tiny so people need to eat and leave so others can also eat.Very nice personnel in reception and specially in the breakfast room. The room has refrigerator and micro and water heater. Daily refill of coffee,tea,sugar and creamer. The room is small and only one chair with no table but we had 2 bureaus which we could use as tables. We slept on newly washed crisp linen  on quite new beds(we were informed). We had good sleep. They provide luggage storage and help with booking transport to Heathrow with reasonable prices. The hotel rates are good for such a central location but we know that we are not paying price for 5 star hotel so we don't expect the same luxury. The hotel is also very close to St Pancras and  the Euro Train which we used to travel to Paris. Oxford Street is one short bus ride. We will come back again.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: December 2019,4.0
