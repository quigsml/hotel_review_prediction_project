We used booking.com And didn’t check trip Advisor first! Our room (203) was directly next to the main electric Box for the whole hotel and the noise was constant,beeping every 30 seconds , as was the buzzer (positioned at our window) for the whole of the Building entering at all times of the night. Appreciate it’s a budget hotel but the idea of A hotel is to have a room to sleep in- sleep is the one thing we didn’t get - they really shouldn’t sell our room 203.",Date of stay: March 2020,1.0

I was in London for a conference around the corner, and had a single basement room for one night. Considering that my accommodation at these things is normally student halls, this was WAY nicer. I was running late so didn't have breakfast, but it was nice that it was included as an option.   Pros: - Ace staff - Clean room and ensuite - Comfy bed - Fast (free) wifi - Powerful, hot shower - LOCATION  - PRICE  Cons: - A bit noisy, but what do you expect in that area?  - The stairs down to the basement were a bit dodgy  Seriously though, if you want a bargain room with good facilities and a great location, you really could do much worse.",Date of stay: March 2020,4.0

I booked through a well known Booking site, I was charged £5 more for a double room on arrival because I could not manage the stairs to the 2nd floor which was a twin room even though I’d contacted the hotel and explained I needed a ground floor, they did say that there were no ground floor rooms but it was 10 to 12 steps to the 1st floor, on arrival told the 1st floor rooms were doubles and that was extra.

No other words!,"We arrived early morning, but couldn't check in until 2, so we were told to leave our luggage in the corner of the room in reception where anyone could have access to it.  We came back at 2pm where we were given our key to our room where we had to go outside and enter the building next door, not a big fan of lift so we used the stairs, which were dangerous as their was very little or no lighting at all, all sorts of rubbish stuck on metal staircase. We then entered the 2nd floor corridor where our room was to be hit with the stench of cannabis, was unbelievably strong, smelt this in a few occasions on returning to our room.   Once we got in the room it didn't stop there , there were 2 bedside tables that had seen better days that housed the toilet rolls, a fan that didn't work, a sky box that looked like it had been thrown around the room 100 times and then taped up,exposed wired on both the tv and the sky box, socket hanging off the wall again with exposed wires.  The shower room floor was absolutely disgusting, absolutely black, the shower tiles again where black with limescale all over the shower head, the view from our window was of a back yard worh graffiti all over the walls and rubbish all over.  Breakfast was poor, the service wasnt good we were greeted with lady who wrote nothing down leading to incorrect orders every morning, did not get everything I asked for at all, breakfast was not great, but eatable.   Breakfast area, lounge area and reception we all in the same room so unable to have any privacy when eating.  Fair to say we will not be returning.…",Date of stay: January 2020,1.0

It was easier to get a ticket for the Chelsea - Ajax game then getting a receipt for your room payment. Didn't had much expectations based on reviews from others, but took the shot because of the low price. And that was a big mistake... Arrived at the room after getting up a hot staircase i almost pulled out the door handle. The room space is simply to small for two persons. The carpet, the walls, the windows, the radiator, the fridge, the shower, it was all just dirty.Room was hot as h#* and airco didn't worked. Asked at the reception to fix this, zero response. Door to the bathroom couldn't be closed, nice when your taking a s#%. Bed was to small for me (i'm 1.87m). What the hotel also is not mentioning in there advertisements: There a train track which kind of lies through you room ( Depends on which side your room is) So after 0500 in the morning, when public transport is starting the hotel starts to shake and you hear a train pass every 2 min (Had plenty of time to count when i lay awake) I can't give a fair opinion about the included breakfast. Simply because i didn't dare to take it based on my experience on the rest of the 'Hotel'. At check out zero interest about my stay experience, and i wanted to leave asap so didn't fancy a discussion.  So my tip to people who are thinking to book a room here: Don't.

The hotel is just a state in my opinion, carpets are dirty, there is rubbish on the floors in the hallway, cleaning in the room seems to be at a minimum, the only reason I gave it one star was because the bed sheets were nice and clean.

It does not matter which wing or floor of the hotel you stay because you will continue to listen to it. It is dirty, very old and dusty. Everything is broken or malfunctioning. The faucets drip, the beds make noise, the spring mattresses are very old and squeak. It is not even pretty or has charm. You can clearly hear anything that other guests in nearby rooms do or say.

The reception area is somewhat attractive, but the rooms are disgraceful. Utterly disgraceful. Cold, cramped, stale rooms that vibrate with every passing train. You will NOT sleep well unless extremely drunk. A team of construction workers started drilling at 1am across the hall from my room, my God what form of management agreed to that!

On entry to the main reception I discovered a huge sitting area, huge TV, a cash machine, a number of breakfasting tables and somewhere in there - the reception desk.  The first issue arose because the receptionist (a very polite and helpful young man) requested that I pay up front in cash otherwise the payment would incur a further 5% charge for using a Switch card.

I was surprised to find out that the lobby is actually the owner's family room, the breakfast room and the reception in one! So every evening when you get back to the hotel, you find owner's friends sitting in the lobby, smoking, surfing the net or watching TV! So the only way you can meet other guests is during the breakfast time, but since the place – the lobby or dining room is cold (even the receptionist is sitting with his jacket on) and full of smoke (because some people smoke during your breakfast!) most of the guests finish their breakfast as soon as possible and disappear.

No sign of any staff in the morning to ask, maybe the mice have eaten it all. To add to our delights we were treated to the sight of a mouse running across our room. Not only do I question the cleanliness but they run a neat little scam that you have to pay cash (not cheques or debit cards but actual hard cash) or they charge you an extra 5%.
