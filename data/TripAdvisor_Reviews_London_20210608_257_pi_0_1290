It was our first trip since Covid hit and I was a bit worried about how safe things would feel, especially in a big city like London. I was happy to see that good procedures were in place and the policy of cleaning at the end of the stay, yet having the option of clean towels etc on request, seemed very sensible.  Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was well air-conditioned, which was great as the temperature outside was very hot. The breakfast routine was different, but staggered sittings meant the room did not feel crowded and people had regard for each other's space and safety. Overall it was a great experience and meant I could see my son for the first time in a year, due to lockdown.  ",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

Service was great, as was the breakfast and selection of choice. Rooms were large and spotless.  The only negative I have of the stay is the ineffective air conditioning in the room.

Air conditioning doesn’t work so all rooms have a little heater in them which makes the rooms unbearable stuffy and warm.   Finally terrible signal on mobile phone.

The lower floors can pick up the news of drunken youths who hang about into the early hours of the morning. In my experience, any floor higher than floor 3 gives a more quiet night’s rest.

One king bed and a proper bed for our teenage daughter. After a long and busy day, collapsed into a very comfortable bed and slept all night! Room was spotless and air con excellent.  Paid for breakfast (children under 16 eat free per full paying adult). Great selection from a buffet, all fresh and not greasy.  Great location and easy access into central London on the tube. Parked the car in the Westfield shopping centre car park which is right by the hotel (£16 for 48 hours).  Would highly recommend and would definitely return.  ",Date of stay: September 2017,5.0

Self checked in and went upto our rooms. We were booked on level 2 and each had our own rooms. Standard premier Inn type rooms with clean comfy beds and clean towels and shower etc. The only problem I found was the room was quite warm and there was no option to open a window. The room did have air con but it didn't do as much good in my opinion as having a window open. We had a few drinks in the bar on reception level which is on the first floor and they have the standard buy one get one free on certain drinks from 5 till 7pm. Quite pricy drinks but it is London and being a Northener we are used to cheaper drinks!
