DoubleTree by Hilton London – Westminster has an excellent team with positive interactions starting from the greeting on arrival, through check-in, greetings when leaving and entering the property, greetings and assistance at breakfast and checkout.  Many full-service properties could learn from here.  Public areas and the 7th floor refurbished guest room were clean, comfortable and in great condition.  The bed was extremely comfortable, the TV worked as it should, amenities included tea and coffee making facilities, an iron, and a hairdryer.  The only slight issue during the stay was that water leaked from around the inset rainfall shower head which has started to damage the ceiling, a job for maintenance (room 722).  Complimentary bottled water and coffee were available in the lobby.  A COVID-friendly Continental breakfast buffet was provided with individual bottled orange juice, individually wrapped croissants and muffins, individual yogurts, individual porridge portions and apples.   A cooked to order breakfast was offered with the vegetarian option, egg and toast options proactively offered.  It was a decent sized portion, served hot and exceptionally well cooked.  Just off Millbank and the river, the hotel is perfect for Westminster.  I needed to be 5km away at Paddington but having read the COVID reviews of the closer properties that I may normally have selected, I am glad to have opted for here - and would certainly return.…",Date of stay: December 2020,5.0

We stayed in the hotel on b&b rate in a deluxe king room. I emailed ahead of our arrival and asked if it was possible to have a high floor room, and we were given a top floor room with views over london. Brekkie was continental, and even after arriving after 9.30am we were still offered food to go with our coffee - nothing was a problem, the staff are a huge asset to this hotel. On our leaving day we checked out, but left our cases whilst we went for a walk along the embankment, again no probs in doing this. It was on returning that i realised id left my watch in the room!

Not much more expensive but a world of difference! Unfortunately I chose this hotel for the position near the Thames. The photos on the website should reflect what is happening at the hotel. I feel that since I also telephoned them to arrange a late departure for what was a 'special' visit, I should have been informed at the time, that it could be necessary due to noise from 9am, to move room! Why not offer a cheap or free upgrade to get you to higher floors? The room was fairly small anyway, I have to say, for a premium room - much bigger ones available elsewhere but sizes not given in their website spec (suppose that should have made me suspicious). The ""continental"" breakfast I was informed about on arrival, was in fact a Parisian snack - plastic wrapped croissant; Bran flakes or Rice Krispies (ask for milk); pod coffee machine; toast (on request); yoghurt. No cold cuts or cheese visible. I was also disappointed to find the windows for the 7th floor lift area, were filthy on the inside. ""Deep cleaning"" appeared to be absent in several places. I was also aghast when I reached the 12th floor gym to find the stairwell with the fire door taken off the automatic closer. Serious H&S breach. No bathrobes found - fairly certain they were supposed to be there. I will happily pay good money for an exceptional hotel but I am truly disappointed with this effort. Positives? The rain-drench shower and the very comfortable bed. Much better value elsewhere.…",Date of stay: October 2020,2.0

On this visit, the room service was a bit disappointing.  I ordered a chicken tikka masala, but when it arrived, the naan bread was replaced with a piece of focaccia... I rang room service and explained this, only to then be asked ""had I wanted naan bread?"".  I replied that the curry should have come with naan bread, so the operator said they'd deliver some shortly.

Certainly, when I checked in at 3 pm, the receptionist just looked at me and said ""Your room is not ready.""  (no indication of when it might be ready, or what to do in the meantime....)  When I got to my room, it was freezing cold. So cold, I had to turn up the heating and go find a cafe to sit if for an hour. When I got back, the room as not much warmer.

The rooms and corridors could do with a tidy up and general refreshing. We did have 5 key failures in the first two days do there is a problem there.

The stated upgrade did not happen, although the duty manager did say that a corner room on level 12 was better than our original. But apart from a different view the room looked basically the same.

I had issues checking in and was asked to come back ""some other time"" when a manager might be working which when I did come back the next day to try and resolve some of the billing issues I got the same dismissive attitude. It could also be a language barrier that made it difficult to communicate at the front desk but that doesn't explain the attitude. On a positive the concierge was very helpful and always willing to help. The rooms are clean and decently appointed but the towels are hard and abrasive. The lounge upstairs has painfully slow service but the breakfast in the morning is decent and well staffed.

The rooms can only be described as river view if you have a 6 foot neck to crane out of the window and peer through the gap in the buildings. Estandby upgrades are a waste of time - we checked in hours early and had no offer on our request. The rooms are tiny. No bigger than a Premier Inn room at all. Everything is small. what happened to just putting a TV on the wall? Not everyone wants in imac.... There is little draw or hanging space and the bathroom is minute.....

Ten minutes from Westminster and Pimlico tube stations. Clean rooms tea and coffee making facilities, a safe, Apple compute/TV, air con and an iron. A lot of the little things that make a hotel. Buffet breakfast was fine but as others have noted it was the same stuff every morning with no variety.  Some things bothered me though. First it should be noted that there is a massive apartment block going up beside and behind the hotel. Construction noise then from 8 to 6 each day that would affect many rooms from what I could see. Not the hotel's fault but worth noting. And it doesn't look like it will be  finished soon. Standard wifi is free but premium must be paid for. At €200 per room this is a little too much.  And then there is the effort to put a…",Date of stay: July 2016,3.0
