We come into the room and first thing we notice is how cold the room is, there is a temperature device on the wall but useless as it didn’t do anything but blow out cold air. Worst thing about it; multiple hair in the bed and on the bed so obviously sheets weren’t changed. So much for “high level of cleanliness”. Went downstairs to tell receptionist and he said there was no one in the building who would change the sheets, me and my family being tired and just wanted to sleep I said I would change the sheets myself. Not really ideal as I’m not a cleaner for the hotel but a customer. Absolutely ridiculous.   Overall, staff were very friendly and tried to help as much as they can. I understand it’s not their fault but the cleaners. Left the name of the cleaner so hopefully she gets a talk too :). Probably the sheets we were sleeping in won’t be changed for the next customers.  …",Date of stay: January 2021,2.0

Then we ordered hot drinks which we were told to self serve. There was no tea bags, no milk and no spoons.

Rooms are clean and fresh, staff are great, the breakfast ticks all the boxes and best of all it’s a 30 second walk from the nearest tube/night tube stop!  The only criticisms are:  1. A cup of tea/coffee from the machines in the lobby will set you back £2.50 (outside of breakfast hours). At Thistle Express hotels I’ve stayed in tea/coffee is free 24 hours a day.  2. The car park is small, costs £10/day and spaces can’t be reserved. If you can’t find a space in the hotel car park, there aren’t any other places to park very nearby, so you may end up parking a distance away – not ideal with overnight bags etc. All in all, still a good value hotel.",Date of stay: March 2019,4.0

I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness and the staff was both friendly and helpful.  Our room was a nice size.  My only complaint that could have made my stay more enjoyable was the bed.  It was not very comfortable - very stiff and bounced a lot when either one of us rolled over or got up.  The breakfast was a nice continental buffet and the room had nice amenities.  The neighborhood was pretty uninteresting - 1 pub on the corner and a middle eastern take out restaurant across the street that had good curry.

What the hotel desperately needs, however, are more cups and glasses.  At busy breakfast times the staff can't seem to wash and recycle them fast enough to meet the demand.
