Duty Manager Anna was so embarrassed for the Hilton Brand on hearing why we had moved that she personally reminded us why we only ever stay at a Hilton.  To say she went above & beyond us an understatement.  Our allocated room blew our mind away, wow, wow, Wow-Factor.  Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt sample the free breakfast as I was in London for an operation & had to be nil by mouth from midnight. Anna on hearing my wife couldn‚Äôt accompany me & had to wait until I was discharged later in the day gave us a late checkout, it didn‚Äôt stop there.......  My wife popped out for a cigarette whilst waiting only to find her room key wouldn‚Äôt work, turned out to be an intermittent fault that maintenance couldn‚Äôt fix for an extended period of time so Anna made sure my wife had everything she needed to make her comfortable in the meantime.  As a business owner, I know the importance of customer service, this blew me away and certainly raised the bar!  Thank You So Much Anna (AKA) The New Hilton Brand Ambassador, we will be back!  My stitches need removing in two weeks so we will be staying again!Ôøº   See you soon we hope, you truly are a diamond  Kind Regards  Graeme & Sara Smith‚Ä¶",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

On this visit, I was told that the Executive Lounge was still closed, and that the hotel is considering closing it for good. If that is true, it is a very disappointing decision. In addition, when I asked what was being offered in place of the Lounge, I was told I could have one drink - in total! In order to get a drink for my partner, I had to explain that my room booking was for two guests! It was that experience in particular that really made me feel like the hotel is just trying to cut costs, and no longer values customers who are loyal Hilton members - at a time when it needs to be doing precisely that, so that they will return and stay again in future. Even with the Lounge being temporarily closed, I would have expected some effort to have gone into an alternative offering. Even one drink per guest cannot seriously be considered an adequate alternative to free use of the Lounge!  I have enjoyed staying at the Hilton Paddington on previous business visits, but if the Lounge now stays closed, I will certainly have to reconsider staying again in future. Hilton hotels should not be withdrawing benefits to (non-US) Diamond members who have worked very hard to earn them, they will end up going elsewhere.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: May 2021,3.0

As diamond members we were ripped off paying ¬£97 for no Executive lounge, no restaurants, no fitness centre, no direct access to Paddington Station and only one person on the reception desk etc etc. At the price charged we expected these services. The most disappointing thing was that the website refers to ‚Äòreduced‚Äô services, when there were none. This in my opinion amounts to false advertising.

I stay at this hotel for its location. In its elegant early days, it was literally was built above Paddington Station, which is now the end point for the 15 minute shuttle from Heathrow. It's great to walk off that train, and go up in the elevator from the station into the hotel lobby.  The hotel also is handy for the Tube and buses.  The breakfast buffet is excellent.  Those pluses being said, otherwise, sadly, it has seen better days in terms of the neighborhood in which it is located having deteriorated, and a standard of service that is not up to other Hiltons.  I have stayed here since it was the Great Western Royal Hotel, then later became a Hilton, which at first was impressive. After an interval of many years I returned and was disappointed. ‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2019,3.0

Had to pay it from private money.  - when I entered my room (it was pretty cold outside), the window was wide open (most likely for hours/days) and temeprature was really low  - heating was not working and I needed to argue for HOURS to get it fixed - my first answer was ""we need a part that's not available so it may take some days"", had to escalate it‚Ä¶",Date of stay: November 2016,1.0

Booked 2 family Superior rooms. Rooms 307 & 311.  The rooms are a very good size. 2 good size queen beds in each room. Check in was fairly quick. We did request an early check in a week beforehand and it was noted and they will try their utmost best . Unfortunately none of the rooms were ready which was disappointing so we left the bags with concierge to see the London sights. Obviously this cannot be guaranteed as normal check in is pm (much later than most hotels). I asked for an upgrade and wasn't offered one. As people have mentioned and I agree that this hotel doesn't go out of it's way to acknowledge that you are HH member.

Also consistent with this is the fact that the hotel was advertising some more expensive rooms that would become available in the near future- so suggestive of a rolling programme of refurbishment perhaps?
