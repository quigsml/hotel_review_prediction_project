Sadly, opening windows have been sealed and the air circulation system does not chill the bedrooms. On a cold May night, the bedroom temperature never fell below 25c. Staff are friendly and cheerful from many cultural backgrounds. The hotel is squeaky clean and the rooms a good size and significantly re-furbished.

The only down-side in my view, is the location, if you're returning to the hotel late at night - personally I think it warrants a taxi right to the door rather than public transport, for safety. Otherwise, 11 out of 10 for these guys - the newly completed refurb makes this an ideal 'budget' hotel - it can still be over £100 at busy times, but on average it has been £100 less than the Mayfair hotels.

Handy for Euston Station and not shabby for Kings Cross St Pancras either. Service wasn't great, staff didn't seem to know what was going on, and check in and check out took a needlesly long time, with the now all too common language barriers in London making things harder. My room was clean, but rather small. Several residents complained about road noise in the rooms on the front of the hotel - ask for a room at the back or side if you want a good night's sleep. Didn't use the restaurant other than for breakfast, which wasn't great even by Premier Inn standards.

The Euston Road hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly. The room was slightly smaller than other PTIs I have stayed in, but it was still sufficient. It is close to the tube and train which is very handy. I did not use the restaurant or bar. Along the lines of other reviews though, the only real downside was the noise from the road - the glazing seemed to make it louder than it should have been! It really was loud, and although it didn't disturb me too much once asleep, it did keep my mother awake. They do warn about it on the website, however the hotel address is not Euston Road, and the map could be interpreted as the hotel being further from the Euston Road than it actually is.…",Date of stay: November 2006,3.0

The front desk staff were friendly, polite and quite helpful. The room was clean, nicely appointed and the bed was good. Even though I was travelling alone, it was good to have a full (queen?) size bed - - - something to remember if I ever go to London with my partner as I simply hate it when hotels put 2 twin beds together and pass it off for a queen.

The bathtub was a decent size and no problem with hot water or water pressure in the shower.  The hotel is in a good location, one block from Euston underground & rail station and buses pass by frequently.  Also, one block from the British Library.
