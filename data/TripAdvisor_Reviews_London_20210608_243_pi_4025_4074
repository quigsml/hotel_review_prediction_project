See you next time!!!,"The hotel staff was not only friendly and helpful, but very efficient. All our requests were taken into account as far as possible. And if something was technically impossible (we requested 3 rooms on the same floor), we were denied a professional, with sincere regret. I think this is the first sign of good management: to teach the staff how to refuse the request in a proper way when something is impossible. I highlighted Aaron, who did everything fast, professional and very sincere (he is just a firework with positive emotions) and Elliot - competence, English restraint and effective assistance in all matters - it just inspires confidence that we can feel comfortable in your hotel.",Date of stay: March 2013,5.0

County Hall has a choice of several, but Premier Inn have, in the last few weeks, added another, located just behind County Hall and near to Waterloo Station. They have taken over an old hospital building, converted it, and added a 14-storey tower block. So you have a choice of characterful rooms with high ceilings, or the more traditional city-centre PI offering. We were on the 11th floor with a corner room which could be set up as a twin or a double, so quite a small room with no sofa, but the usual fitment incorporating open shelves, tv, kettle, and hairdrier.

I have to travel alone more than I used to and I love them (until this one) because normally you get a cheerful, friendly welcome, quick check-in whenever you turn up and a reasonably sized (albeit no-frills) bedroom. This new hotel at Waterloo was dreadful.  OK so the price was good at face value. The location is fabulous. The breakfast lives up to the Premier Inn norm, which I love - it is usually high quality and excellent value for money. Also it was clean and new as it had only been open a week.

Staff are polite and helpful. The hotel had only been open two weeks when we stayed. We found the rooms quite a lot smaller than any other Premier Inn we have stayed in, this may be due to its good location and them wanting to fit as many rooms in as possible.

Breakfast buffet bar is in a small cramped area and this caused bottlenecks meaning food got cold, they offer different types of eggs cooked to order, but in my opinion, I would drop this, they either come too early or too late to go with the rest if your food, nice offer but not needed, move the toasters out of the middle of the breakfast bar and ditto the coffee machine, sort these odd simple bits and it will change the experience, at the moment advise going early for breakfast.

Joined on is the newer tower block with most of the rooms in. The only real negative was not having the rooms made up until so late in the day.

Yes, it´s a budget hotel but the room had all we needed, comfortable bed, extra pillows, tea/coffee, hairdryer, very clean (yes it´s brand new), good warm&strong shower, good housekeeping. It´s a great location, walking distance to a lot of premier sights in London, close to tube and buses to take you everywhere. Very helpful staff at reception and in the restaurant in the morning. They will soon have more knowledge about the neighborhood  so they can help you with recommendations for restaurants/pubs etc. We found a nice pub at Roupell st, Kings Arms. Will definitely stay here again. Ask for top floors with a view.",Date of stay: March 2013,4.0

Room small, but clean and comfortable. Breakfast excellent with plenty of waiting staff to help. We did eat in the restaurant on one night but the menu is bog standard pub fare and could be improved by having fresh chef made meals.  This hotel had only been open 5 days when we stayed and everybody was really trying to make our stay as stress free as possible.

The room was on the small side but had everything you needed - shower gel, soap, tea, coffee, tv, hairdryer.  There wasn't  a bath but a double sized shower. The bed - very very comfortable.   The room overlooked York Road (on 4th floor) but was extremely quiet.  Couldn't fault it. In the morning, we took a late-ish breakfast and so did quite a few others - but the food kept coming out and the staff were great in advising people that more was on it's way.  For £8.95, we thought it good value. Location-wise - if you're coming out of Waterloo station, look for the York Road exit - it will save you time! It's a 2 minute walk from the London Eye, Aquarium, London Dungeon etc.  All in all, a great…",Date of stay: March 2013,5.0

We were in room 1302 which had amazing views of the London skyline, it was superb waking up to views of the London Eye and Big Ben from my bed.  I absolutely loved the automated check-in. We found the staff on hand very friendly and very helpful everywhere we met them, be it in reception, in the corridor or in the lifts.  The room was a good size, certainly big enough for our needs. The beds were very comfortable, too, and a decent range of channels on the tv.  The only drawback - and it wasn't major - was the lack of internet in the room.

Eventually turn up at the hotel and i am told the systems are down so i have to fill in a form. I had my printed reservations with me so gave it to them yet they wanted me to  fill a form which had all the details as my reservation printout! Anyway after a half hour wait i am given a room where i leave my bag and off to work. Return later and the view out of my room is of a wall overlooking an office. Have a shower and notice the extractor fan does not switchoff. Informed staff who stated its late and will look at it in the morning.

Nothing wrong with that, except that they do so by penalising single travellers like myself. I was given a dark poky room with a tiny window and no view, and it really spoiled my stay. The position of the hotel is excellent for the South bank, but the building does have many rooms that overlook pretty depressing buildings, with small windows that give a 'cell' like feeling! £130.00 pounds is too much to pay for such inferior accommodation. I trust that the family rooms are much better.",Date of stay: March 2013,3.0

The staff were very helpful and so friendly but I'd agree that the rooms were smaller than in previous PI's that we've stayed, although this is not something that can be levelled against the staff & management; we'd have no hesitation in returning here.  Can't comment on the restaurant regarding dinner, but breakfast was excellent and little snags that occurred will soon be ironed out when the staff are more experienced.  Would recommend a Turkish restaurant called Troia which is on Belvedere Road behind the building opposite the hotel - we had a great meal there.",Date of stay: March 2013,4.0

Good welcome on reception and decent enough location close to the tube station.  I stay in Premier Inns quite a bit and there are issues with this one some of which are teething issues, some structural.  The rooms are much smaller than usual, mine was anyway, room 312. The shower head leaked. I prefer clean air with being allowed to open windows. They are locked here 'for your safety' which I have no idea how that helps my safety but there we go.  The main issue was the restaurant, the service was awful and slow, continually chivvying the staff along to order a drink, order food, food to turn up and when it did it wasn't good. It wasn't even busy. It had only been open a week and I'm sure they will sort those issues out. I fairness…",Date of stay: March 2013,2.0

Built on the site of the General lying in hospital, the older part has been modernised very sympathetically, and the extension built on the site of the nurses accommodation next door, is 14 floors high. Fantastic views of the london eye, big ben and the houses of parliament. We stayed on the 12th floor, room 1205. Fantastic nights sleep.My husband was born in the hospital, so he really enjoyed the nostalgic trip. We were shown around by one of the reception staff,  who enjoyed showing us all the historic bits of the hospital.
