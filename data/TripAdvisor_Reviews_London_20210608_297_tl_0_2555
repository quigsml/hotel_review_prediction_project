A 3 night stay with a late check out was £129.  On arrival, the last was really helpful. She checked us in and as we were staying for 3 nights put us on the quiet first floor, so that we didn't get disturbed.  Our first room had no taps on the sink and so we went back down and they sorted me another room (117).  The rooms are a bit dated and the carpet is looking tired. The windows are dirty. There were no cups or glasses in the room and so I sent my son down for some. Again, the staff sorted it out.  The staff did tell us that our room would not be cleaned during our stay, but if we needed anything to ask. We needed more towels and this was sorted for us.  Our key cards stopped working a few times, so we had to get these re-activated. I was a solo traveller with 2 kids (4 and 11) and I felt safe as you needed a key card to access the floor and then the key card to access the room.  Our room was facing the road and had 2 sets of windows. I didn't hear any noise and we all slept really well during our stay. I would say, ask for a room away from the train track as most people's complaints circle around the noise of trains.   I stayed here due to the 4 star rating on Tripadvisor. I have stayed at other Travelodge's in  Central London and feel this was the most worn out one in the city that I have stayed at. Having said that, it has a very central location, but so have the others I've stayed at. I am surprised at the high rating for this hotel.  This aside, the hotel was really cheap and a bargain. It just felt worn out, but the staff were friendly enough and obviously this is a reflection of the price we paid.  We didn't eat at the hotel. We had breakfast one morning at At Katharine's dock and the other 2 mornings at the Wetherspoons opposite the Tower of London.  If you're on a budget, stay here, but understand it is a little worn.…",Date of stay: June 2021,3.0

Great location for our trip - minutes from Tower of London but also easily walkable to The Shard, via either Tower or London Bridge, so Borough Market etc is all easily reachable.  Although there’s loads of places to eat out around the hotel, the breakfast is well worth a try. You have to book a time slot whilst social distancing is in place and it’s effectively table service, but that makes for an enjoyable experience.

No wardrobe, no hairdryer or iron. Pipe work need a big improvement as well. You can’t flash the toilet without horrendously rumbling noise as if explosion was happening.

This is typical of the Travelodge template.  Clean entrance. Rooms clean but not spacious. If you like to swing a cat then the rooms are not for you unless you accidentally book a 'disabled room' which is mahoosive. If you are on a tight budget book this Travelodge in advance. Breakfast adequate. I am told the evening meals are ok for thise on a budget. The pub next door is ok but charges premium prices for a pint - walk extra 2 minutes to the Wetherspoons for a reasonably priced tipple.

The staff were friendly, although one of the breakfast guys was a bit power crazy with his sheets of A4 barking out ""Room number."" Now the cons - the hotel is very hot, both the corridors and rooms. And you can't open the window due to road being one side and the railway line on the other. Also the rooms were quite grubby. The bathroom floor had seen better days, there was a nasty looking stain on the carpet and I found a contact lens lying in the bathroom! The carpets in the corridor were also a bit many.
