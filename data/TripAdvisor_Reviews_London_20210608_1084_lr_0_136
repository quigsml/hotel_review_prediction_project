I know it's cheap but seriously, cheap doesn't always have to be lousy!  My husband and I were totally disgusted walking into the ""hotel"". Very strong curry smell all over the place! We were shocked to when we walk into our room, it is just a very tiny cubical with a super single bed they called DOUBLE. We don't even have space for our luggage! Ridiculous!   It was winter but guess what, they don't even have a proper blanket. It was a carpet wrap in some sheets and barely enough for one person. The bedsheet they lay over the mattress was so short that it revealed the side of the mattress and I requested for a change before going out but no one came!

Ahmet and the staff were very friendly and the room I received was wonderful.  Despite being a bit small and in the basement it was clean, warm, with a double bed, fridge, tea making facility, and a television that got every channel.  The bathroom was quite large compared to other rooms upstairs and in a long hallway separate from the bedroom.  The free Wifi in the rooms is a total plus and worked great throughout my stay.  The free breakfast consisted of cereals, breads and fried eggs with beans and toast, plus tea and coffee; it got crowded in the reception/lobby area but was worth the wait. The hotel is located in a quiet section of Shepherd's Bush but there are businesses, restaurants and a giant Tesco within short walking distance. …",Date of stay: December 2012,5.0

Firstly, as soon as  we walked into the room  it was like walking into a sauna. We  originally thought that it was just because the heating was on and that the window was closed. However, the heating was off and the window would only open slightly so had no effect whatsoever. We then realised that we were given the room with the big boiler tank in the cupboard!! which was providing the sauna-like experience in the room.

Our room was tiny, no wardrobes available, a small refrigerator next to the bed making noise and the bathroom room just big enough for a person to stand in it!
