We booked to stay this weekend but London went into Tier 3 and the attraction we were visiting closed following government guidelines as did all cafes and restaurants. We contacted our bus service that followed procedures in getting us a refund credit to rebook. This hotel however refused to cancel or amend the booking!  We contacted Trip.com, where we booked the hotel, who did their best to get us a refund but they also refused to refund to Trip.com. We contacted customer services and every single operator put us on hold or transferred us from department to department untill they said there was nothing they could do. Eventually we contacted the hotel direct who told us THEY WERE CLOSED FOR COVID LOCKDOWN!! So they were not able to even offer us the hotel stay but were still refusing to refund us. Luckily Trip.com were able to offer us an enforced refund after I they confirmed it would be closed over our booked dates when they contact the hotel as well.   A shambles of a hotel run by a corrupt customer services. AVOID AVOID AVOID Not worth the risk should anything go wrong before or during your stay.   For anyone else going through this issue in the UK contact CMA on the government website to report hotels and services acting unfairly during lockdown restriction. They offer to take the hotel to court on your behalf if no resolution can be found.…",Date of stay: December 2020,1.0

It makes life easier after a shw, rather than painstakingly trying to get home late at night to stay overnight and then get a nice breakfast in the morning to round off our trip.  This time, after watching Magic Goes Wromg (fantastic show by the way), we stayed in the OYO Royal Park Hotel in Bayswater. We just wanted something cheap to rest our heads as the hotels closer to the theatre were extremely expensive (£200 a night for me is expensive).   The hotel forewarned us that there was maintenance going on at the hotel so we were prepared for some loudness. However, surprisingly, there wasn't any. There was a little drilling at around 3:30 but other than that nothing. We was expecting to be woken up at 9 on Sunday so that was…",Date of stay: January 2020,5.0

It seemed clean and offered everything I needed for the night albeit very basic. However very short lived. Within 15 minutes of checking into the hotel, I found I had stained bed sheets and duvet with a freakishly strong smell of beach and stained towels. Then the fire alarm went off around 30 times for around 2 hours from 11.45pm. Only one member of staff named Ali was available on site who refused to do anything to fix the problem. He said and I quote “I’m just the receptionist, it’s not my problem.

I have never experienced the sheer lack of concern or care for guests as I have here never mind the lack of knowledge or training that the staff, management or otherwise, clearly had. We had a small basement room and for the three nights we stayed the fire alarm was constantly going off due to an obvious fault that the night worker clearly had no idea how to or in actual fact cared to fix or who to call to help.

So at approx 11.45pm on Monday 20th January when the fire alarm in the hotel tripped, yes I was grumpy (I’d just drifted off) yet I held no ill feeling toward the young lady who wandered the corridors telling the guests that is was a false alarm. I subsequently had a great nights sleep.
