The stern receptionist was the lowlight.‚Äô,"I stayed here for one night during England‚Äôs COVID restrictions.  My check in experience was smooth, but I found the receptionist almost ‚Äòaggressive‚Äô in her tone and manner.  Go here.  Go there.  Do this.  Do that.  It almost felt like being checked into a prison, not that I‚Äôd know what that‚Äôs like, as my criminal record is non existent of course.  Maybe she was new or just ensuring she covered everything, but I‚Äôd have welcomed a friendly smile.  The room, like many IHG hotels was tired and in need of modernisation, but was spotlessly clean, which I appreciated.  I spent very little time in the hotel but I was delighted to see Draught Corona on the bar, but it was served without lime and in the incorrect glassware which was disappointing, as I‚Äôd been wanting to try this product for many months.  The barman was much happier than the receptionist however.  He laughed as my colleague almost inadvertently stole a Snickers Bar.   The rate was incredibly high for such a tired hotel, but the location is excellent so this is worth at least some of high tariff.  I may stay again if the receptionist cheered up due to it‚Äôs location, but the rooms are in dire need of modernisation.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2021,2.0

For breakfast, they had several choices of food and drinks (we are lactose intolerant and appreciated them having soy milk on tap!) and we had pancakes made from scratch, which were lovely.

Camden is a small ""town"" with lots of lively bars and restaurants... but actually not that great on a Thursday night.   The Hotel is on a canal but we had a room overlooking a small area (not even a courtyard). Very disappointing (room 330). Everyone was friendly and the bar area was good for a quiet chat at 10 pm.   Breakfast was excellent ¬£13.50 as it wasn't in our room rate and very good for a buffet style hotel affair. Camden itself wasn't really awake at 10 am so it was a good choice.   In summary, it was a good alternative to central London but although there was nothing wrong, we doubt we'll go back. ",Date of stay: November 2016,4.0

We chose this hotel over an airport hotel because of the fact that it offered rooms at affordable prices with two double beds - and with two adults and two, slightly older children, two proper double beds were needed.  The room we were allocated for our brief stay was room 226. We were very impressed with the room due to the following reasons: *Sleep quality: the two double beds were very comfortable and we all got a good night's sleep. *Air-conditioning: Room 226 had a/c which meant that because it was hot in London, we could keep the a/c on overnight, making for a more comfortable night's sleep. *General cleanliness: The room and en-suite were‚Ä¶",Date of stay: August 2016,5.0

This hotel provides an excellent way to enjoy the many exotic and varied delights of Camden. 2 mins walk from the action - and a good, if a little dull, bolt hole from the action. Staff are polite, rooms clean and surprisingly roomy for London.  Two things - people have complained about the food. The answer is simple - you're in Camden - go explore! There are loads of options within just a few paces of the hotel.  Second - parking is not ideal. If you're planning to drive try to per-book one of the hotel spaces or prepare yourself for a 10 minute walk from the public car park. Far from ideal if it's raining and/or you are tired.  Enjoy Camden Town!",Date of stay: November 2012,4.0

The staff was very nice and attentive. Allways a hello for you when you met them at the reception or the hallway. Room was a good size and the breakfast was typical english, but very good. Camden is not for me at night, too noisy, and I am a light sleeper, so I should have bought some earpluggs. I asked for a room not facing the Lock, but they were fully booked. WiFi is not free, and that is strange. Had free WiFi at Holiday Inn in New York. During the day Camden is like a little village with a Whole Foods and super restaurants. Loved it.
