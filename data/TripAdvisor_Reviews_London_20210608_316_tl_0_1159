Room was snug but this was not a problem for me. Staff I encountered were very friendly. I was offered an upgrade from my single to a double which was great. Some noise from other guests but it was a bank holiday weekend so expected!  I was by a lift so there was noise there but I was a solo female guest and it's their policy that these guests are near lifts which is not a bad thing.

Well to my surprise the hotel was fantastic, we did have the new 'super' rooms but it surpassed all expectations. The bathroom was fresh and clean, the pillows and duvet were very comfortable and the added bonus of a coffee pod machine in the room topped it off. There were USB port for charging, plenty of hangers, a decent mirror for getting glammed up and a proper hairdryer, not one where you have to hold the button in to work. The staff could not have been better, quick and simple check in and out, when the counter was unmanned, a quick call to the number they put on reception and he appeared within 2 minutes.  Its right by Bank station (if you find the right exit of course!) and also same distance to Cannon Street station. I had a brilliant nights sleep here and I will definitely consider Travelodge more often if I am only using it to sleep and shower.…",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

However I feel any potential visitors need to be warned of the mosquito issue I wish I’d read the reviews before I booked because both myself and my wife were bitten multiple times on our two night visit. We reported this to the hotel who are admitting no responsibility despite multiple reviews citing the same issue.   On a different note we stayed in the Travelodge near the gherkin the night prior and not only did we not get bitten but there was a decent bar.

The room was freezing and there was only a small heater on the wall that took ages to warm the room up, pulled covers on bed back to find what looked like a pubic hair then when trying to sleep got woken up about 4am by what sounded like industrial bins being emptied and loud talking outside (despite being on the top floor). Lots of reviews mention the powerful showers but although it was quite powerful the poor layout and shower curtain resulted in a very wet bathroom floor.  Not sure what’s super about this room but they need to improve their cleaning and also invest in better windows. The only good thing about my stay was the location. ",Date of stay: February 2018,3.0

(cheapest we could find.) I was greeted on arrival by a lovely member of staff (can't remember her name) she apologised for the building works that were happening next door and was happy to help if we wanted a different room. Stayed on the 3rd floor near a linen closet so of course there was a little bit of noise during the morning. I have worked in a hotel before so I didn't mind. The only complaint I have is that when the room was cleaned that the room attendant didn't leave a second towel so on the morning of our departure my Boyf and I had to share a towel.

It was the same day as the London marathon so it was pretty busy/fully booked but there was no problem with noise.    The hotel was in a good situation and was only a few minutes walk from a tube station.   We booked this hotel in the sale and only paid £35 for a room on a Sunday which is extremely good value for a hotel in Central London.   The only downside was that there was no where to store bags (there was in the travelodge I previously stayed in in southwark) which meant that we had to pay to leave our bags at one of the main stations with a left luggage facility. This wasn't a big problem considering the hotel was so cheap. But it would have been  nice if there had been such a facility.,Date of stay: April 2014,5.0

I'd arrived on an early flight from New York, so got the Tube to Bank and walked to the hotel (took about 5 mins). It's on a pedestrianised street and the hotel's entrance itself is inside a small courtyard, so you can easily go past it if you miss the sign.  I'd booked early check-in (from 12pm) but was still allowed to check-in at 11.50am (never know with Travelodge!). Have forgotten the receptionist's name but she was really helpful and I was given a room on the 3rd floor - the lift wasn't the biggest but was quick enough.

Pros: Good location, clean, comfortable, pillows and duvets may have been brand new, very little noise for being central.
