The maid forget to replenish the sachets of coffee and tea on one of the days I stayed but always changed the towels, even when they were hung up. The pillows were so flat that even two were not really comfortable. The hotel's location is reasonable but it's not really a budget hotel.

A decent sized double room with private bathroom, TV and tea and coffee facilities. It was an ideal location - West Brompton tube station is just down the road. Buses run from opposite the hotel. It was only around 7 minutes on the bus to the Natural History Museum and to lots of lovely cafes, bars and restaurants in South Kensington. Very easy access to central London.

Ageing but decent hotel,"At just a few minutes walk from the tube that is direct to the embankment the hotel is in a fantastic location for sightseeing. The area around the hotel is full of little restaurants, pubs and takeaways which is handy too. The hotel itself has masses of space on the lower floors which gives it an airy feel. The hotel car park is a little tight but there were plenty of spaces available during my visit. The hotel rooms are beginning to age now but they are very well kept and tidy. I have to say that the rooms are a little small for a stay more than a few days and there is a poor TV choice but other than that it's fine. Overall if the price is right this is a great place to stay for anyone wanting to get around London. I would definitely stay again. ",Date of stay: October 2015,3.0

Ibis Earl's Court is a very basic hotel without many of the amenities that North Americans may be used to.

At 4am I went to the pub to get some cereal; the manager was short with me and said the pub is closed. When I explained to him that breakfast was available at 4, he was a little miffed and called someone from the front desk. The front desk guy came up to the pub to offer me an ""early riser"" of coffee/tea and a croissant.
