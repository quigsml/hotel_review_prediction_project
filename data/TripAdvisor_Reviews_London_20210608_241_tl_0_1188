Bought the upgraded room for the stay and it was clean & comfortable. Amenities are basic but present. Ideal location for a hub when visiting to London. If you are very pedantic there were some niggles in the room - that do catch your attention, but generally enjoyed our stay.   All the staff interactions we had were spot on - and they were so friendly and helpful.   We did have breakfast one morning on site and the ladies that dealt with us were fantastic - nothing was an effort and they were continually checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed.   Would happily stay again. ",Date of stay: June 2021,4.0

The room was very comfortable.  There was a hairdryer in the room which some hotels in the Travelodge chain only have behind reception. The breakfast was good with a wide choice of hot and cold food.  It is a big hotel which perhaps explains why the catering and bar are better than others in the chain.  It was quiet in the room.  It is very near the Old Vic and Waterloo Station.  The staff were very helpful and cheerful! ,Date of stay: January 2020,5.0

Firstly, not long after we arrived, one of the two lifts broke down and remained that way for the entire weekend.  I know it’s a bank holiday weekend but I’d still expect Travelodge to throw money at the problem to get it resolved.  The other gripe I had is that they only provide two bath towels for a double room, no hand towels.

This Travelodge is on a few minutes walk from Waterloo Station, down south past the Old Vic theatre.   It’s convenient, easy to find and clean. I had a room facing to the rear of the hotel, so did not notice any noise from the main road. The room they gave me (as a late booking) was one of their disabled rooms. So large and spacious.   There is food available at the bar and the rooms offer 30 minutes free WiFi.   As a location, just on the outskirts of central London, this hotel couldn’t be better.
