The receptionist who checked us in was lovely. It’s in an amazing location within walking distance to great places like Hoxton, Shoreditch, Brick Lane, Spitalfields etc. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and pillows to die for. Modern facilities were great (good hairdryer, speakers in the bathroom ceiling) etc. with a good range of TV channels. The room was extremely clean and the complimentary wine in the room for my boyfriend’s birthday was a lovely touch!   We had an issue with the hot water twice during our stay - for the price of the hotel, I feel hot water is a basic facility. That said, the reception manager did deal with it very well when raised. The room is quite small for the price and as someone who likes fresh air in the morning, especially in smaller spaces, I prefer when there is at least a little window to crack open every now and then! I also would appreciate a bit more tea in the room (one English breakfast tea for two people over the course of two days is slightly stingy) and perhaps some biscuits to nibble on or something!   Sadly we didn’t get to try the food but the menus looked delicious and good variety. We will return - thank you :) …",Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

Quiet, despite being on a busy road. The room is very comfortable with nice large, comfortable bed. Friendly restaurant staff and a good breakfast.  Slight niggle with the lovely bathroom however. The temperature of the water is not quite hot enough. Its difficult to have a good hot bath, which I like when I'm away. I resorted to boiling a kettle and adding it to the bath water... The other issue with the bath is the overflow is too low down, so  even though the bath appears large, you can't fill it anywhere near high enough to have a good soak.

The same cannot be said for the Hart, and whilst I get that it’s brand new, it’s a full league above its sister brands (and other hotels) nearby.  New buildings create a positivity in a neighbourhood and the Hart brings an energy to the main thoroughfare, it’s subtly buzzing.  The welcome I received was warm, enthusiastic and professional. As a diamond member I was automatically upgraded to a suite and I was impressed. The room was a good size (for a London), the bed super comfy, clean and well appointed. They’ve embraced a Shoreditch hip/modern approach to decoration.   Breakfast was excellent - no crappy buffet of congealing sausages and bacon, but a super healthy modern a la carte.  …",Date of stay: February 2020,5.0

My husband and I stayed in a king deluxe room on the 5th floor on a Sunday night and were leaving before breakfast started at 6.30am.  We asked if there were any offerings we could have earlier (pastries or similar).  A front of house team member tried to arrange something but unfortunately it wasn’t possible because there wouldn’t be any kitchen staff available earlier. Whilst there’s an argument to say the food offering should be more flexible, I was impressed by the effort put in to try and accommodate us.

I originally chose this hotel because of its location to the conference center, option for breakfast, and the availability of a gym. It was so kind (and very much appreciated!) that Julian who was at the front desk on 1/23/2020 allowed an early check in since I arrived at the hotel from a red eye flight from the States at 9am. It was sooooo nice to be able to immediately shower and lie down and figure out the jetlag!  My stay included breakfast daily. As another reviewer wrote, I am also used to the buffet style breakfast. However, ordering from the menu was fine. Got my eggs, juice, and coffee everyday :-) The staff were always very pleasant and attentive! Food came everyday very fast!

Location is very good being close to Shoreditch and Moorgate. My only criticism would be that breakfast is slightly ‘strange’. As a business traveller, I personally prefer a buffet breakfast which enables me to grab a bowl of cereal and go. However there seems to be a strange system whereby you have to order food from a menu which means I was waiting circa 10-15 mins for a bowl of granola (consequently staff got the order wrong and bought me a bowl of porridge, complete with colourful flowers!). The only hot drinks included with breakfast were breakfast tea and filter coffee. I was informed I would be required to pay extra for a latte. Maybe this type of system works for tourists but overall I find it a bit too elaborate…",Date of stay: January 2020,4.0

Often, I have colleagues with me and act as the advance guard for hotel choices.  I have tried many hotels on the west and east side, and quite a few in the City or business center.  There are some great choices but some of the best come with crazy price tags - the Andaz and Threadneedles are great but among the most expensive. I had been going to the Doubletree near the Towers but the management, customer service, room size, bathroom, AC all are sub par and declining over time.

I could not be more pleased with my experience and would say that my time at the hotel was one of my favorite parts of my trip! The room itself was stunning and very comfortable and the common areas were homey and well-decorated.
