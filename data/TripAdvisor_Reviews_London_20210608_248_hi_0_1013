My family enjoyed their stay in a pleasant room.  Breakfast was tasty and consisted of cereals, pastries and sausage and bacon baps.  One of the staff was over-enthusiastic about challenging children and adults with exemptions for not wearing masks.  However his colleagues helped out and put him straight.  The one issue I had with the room was that it was near the Underground line was outside the window and a little noisy at times.  The location is perfect for visiting the  beautiful Ravenscourt Park and close to Hammersmith Underground and Bus Station.  Had a lovely time.",Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

Reception and bar / lounge are are a big improvement and somewhere you could easily spend time in the evening.  Biggest issue I found though was that the extension backs right on to a tube line and the noise of the trains going past was really annoying, so I’d recommend asking for a room nearer the main road or you risk the tube line noise. Room 012 should be avoided as well as the tube line it has a lovely view of a brick wall - not what I expect as a spire IHG rewards member in a hotel that wasn’t busy.  The rooms are very good aside with the refurb making them better, walk in shower with great water pressure, really comfortable bed.  A really handy position in the middle of shopping area, good transport links, places to eat and bars so I’d recommend and will go back as long as I can avoid the rooms that back on to the tube line…",Date of stay: April 2021,4.0

3,/Hotel_Review-g186338-d242713-Reviews-or0-Holiday_Inn_Express_London_Hammersmith-London_England.html#REVIEWS,Holiday Inn Express London - Hammersmith Hotel Reviews,Hard to fault. Excellent property.,"You really can always rely on the Holiday Inn Express brand. Even in these COVID challenging times, they're still delivering first class service at very affordable rates. All London rates have plummeted during the COVID epidemic, making this property an even more impressive bargain.  The hotel is located in the heart of Hammersmith, close to the river walk, all the shopping & venues and a fairly short walk from both Hammersmith & Ravenscroft Park tube stations. Be aware that Ravenscourt Park (technically the closest tube stop, but the difference from Hammersmith is marginal) has no elevators. If you've got luggage to juggle, the stairs at this station are very tricky to navigate. Uber, taxis and indeed buses, will of course also take you to the hotel door.  The hotel is intriguing architecturally. There was a hotel here already and from the outside, you can see the heritage building. However, the majority of the space is new build and regardless, inside, it's all brand new. In other, COVID free times, I'd have liked to explore the full interior, but that's just not practical right now. You will need a mask in the public areas at all times and the staff are fully compliant themselves.  The staff are super friendly, helpful and nice and are doing their best despite the reduction in their numbers due to the pandemic. The bar is functioning, but it and the restaurant are closed for seating. Breakfast is still available at no additional charge and again, they're doing a great job at providing as close to full service options as possible. Coffee & tea are available, juices, cereals, milk, yogurt, oatmeal, toast, preserves, fresh fruit and both sausage or bacon in rolls. That they can do all this, entirely COVID compliant and at a low rate included in the room charge, is something so many other properties could study and learn from.  Rooms are brand new, spacious, clean and comfortable. There's a desk and comfortable seating as well as comfortable beds with clean, fresh linens. The curtains provide total black out, but even the double glazing doesn't entirely shut out the noise from outside. You will hear tube trains or traffic thundering by depending on what side your room faces, but it's not intrusive. What is tricky is the room-room noise. It is fairly loud. A problem you'll be familiar with in almost all Holiday Inn properties. Every word of every conversation by your neighbours can e be heard through the adjoining doors. Shame. There is limited space for luggage and clothing, but enough if you're on your own. There's a kettle, tea, coffee, iron, ironing board and hairdryer. Because of COVID, house keeping is very limited and if you really need it, you need to arrange it in advance as staff are limited. Refills of tea & coffee can be grabbed from the cafe or by asking at the front desk, where you can also get towels or soap refills. WIFI is reliable and free and there's a big flat screen TV with many channels.  I was in a disabled equipped room, so the bathroom is probably not standard. There was a free, open shower, with no bath tub, as well as two basins. Other rooms may have different configurations. Regardless, the hot water pressure is excellent, the decor, tiling, shower stall etc are all brand new and spotless. Towels are clean and fresh. There's liquid soap/shampoo in containers locked to the walls.  Being a new property obviously sets this hotel up a notch, but even so, what they're offering for the rates charged is astonishingly good. Post COVID, I'd be more than happy to come back and give it another whirl. I doubt I'd be disappointed.…",Date of stay: January 2021,5.0

It was another wonderful stay even though I was below par health wise. Was checked in by the excellent Monica along with some other familiar faces. My wife had already arrived.  I want to pay tribute to all of the staff who were working there on 17th and 18th. Renovations were in full swing which meant that the reception area had been relocated to floor 1 and no hot food was available for breakfast.

This one is certainly not one of them. It may not be in the heart of London but it is very central with shops and restaurants in walking distance and a great place to stay. Breakfast area was great with a good choice of food and beverages. The room was very comfortable (bigger than average hotel rooms in central London), so was the bathroom.

When we arrived there was a makeshift reception area on the first floor. Breakfast was a Grab'n Go set up in a meeting room, boxed cereals, croissants, mini muffins etc. You had to bring the food back and eat it in your room. We just had the feeling like we were staying in more like a hostel than a hotel. I must add that I don't think I'll book a room in a Holiday Inn Express anymore as the rooms are so cramped. We booked 2 rooms as we are a family of 5, kids are 17,14 and 12 and prefer their own space. Even with the kids in one and us in the other, there was very little room to move around in either room.

The rooms are small but adequate, cosy and equipped with everything one will expect from a budget business hotel like internet connectivity, comfortable bed, a TV and a tea/coffee maker set.

Hammersmith is not pretty but it certainly offers shops, bars and restaurants and an easy commute to central London.   The only disappointment was breakfast - the scramble eggs were really dry and there was no-one around so I had to find my way to table and buffet. Not a big problem but certainly this is an area for improvement.   I recommend the German bakery opposite Hotel (2mins walk) - lovely bread and sandwiches.",Date of stay: November 2017,4.0

Breakfast is included, but super poor (every day same selection, awful coffee), and room mega crowded. Wifi also included, but slower than old dial connexions.

That said parking is limited so get there early or have a back up plan. Staff were polite, efficient and friendly and very helpful when my room key didn't work first time. The 'free' breakfast doesn't add up for me as it's included in the room cost somewhere but at a total cost of £136 for the night I'm not complaining. Rooms are fairly modern, clean and well kept. Only points which didn't go down so well where the very early morning bottle recycling truck crashing the empties out from a skip and having someone else's address on my invoice - minor points but worthy of note.   ***Please indicate if this review was useful to you - thank you***",Date of stay: November 2013,4.0

I don't think it's fair for people to say there's not enough choice, bland, etc. when it is made clear at the time of booking that this is a complimentary service. Whilst I have no doubt that this ""extra"" service is charged within the room rate I still feel it unfair for others to imply that this is poor value.
