The swimming pool is ok but the shallow end is SO shallow you can’t swim to the end.  Also they give kid classes in part of the pool but it was still fun to have. For us the location was great.

I needn’t have worried. Staff went out of their way to keep everything clean and feeling safe. You do need to book to use the gym and pool, but it’s no hardship and easy to do. The exec lounge is closed, as with many chains, they give a voucher for the bar daily instead. Not quite the same, but it is sensible and necessary.

Pros:-  Our room was a good size with kitchenette area and Nespresso-type coffee machine. But some things did not work such as the bedside USB sockets, and the bathroom was small relative to overall room.  The gym was well equipped.  Cons:- The first thing to note is the location. It’s actually quite a long walk from Regent’s Park as the hotel is located in Swiss Cottage. Good for strolls to St John’s Wood and Primrose Hill however.   The lobby area (including the lobby bar) are not particularly attractive or inviting.   The pool - which was one of the amenities that attracted us to the hotel - was fairly busy between 08:00 and 14:00 with children swimming lessons.   The executive lounge was closed due to COVID. To be fair, almost all hotels have closed their lounges during the pandemic.   We reported an issue to the reception who advised that they would call us with a solution. However, they never did call us!   Breakfast was a sorry affair, set in their conference room it felt like dining in a stark hospital canteen. The menu was very limited too with nothing cooked to order.…",Date of stay: October 2020,3.0

Every single time I would like to go up or down, I'd have to wait for 10minutes+ since the elevator capacity for the hotel is grossly underbuilt. It gets to a point where you have 30+ people waiting for the elevators downstairs, and hence you'll have to wait 4-5 rotations in the queue before you get a chance to go where you wish.

It’s clean, modern, and comfortable. The staff are lovely and the rooms were clean and had a huge amount of space!   The only problem I had was that the hotel didn’t provide its own menu/restaurant. Not everyone likes Carluccios, and unless you’re up between midnight and 6am, that is the only food available to you within the hotel. I definitely think the hotel should offer its own restaurant and it’s own room service to offer the best options to everyone. Our food at Carluccios was very mediocre, I’d say it was worse than Pizza Express, and for a 4 star hotel I don’t think this is good enough.

Inside the room, renovations are excellent visually: classy, modern feel, Marriott overlooked a basic element of a hotel- comfortable sleeping. Cheap low grade thermostat was installed; does not work, which means you either sleep in sauna like conditions or as a reviewer noted below, AC runs all night.    Too much to ask a modern hotel to allow guests to control temperature of the room?  Apparently, here it is.  Brought this to attention of the mgmt. and received a lame offer of a free drink.   So overall, the line staff was excellent but hotel is let down by parsimonious, dumb management decisions. Bye bye Marriott.",Date of stay: October 2017,2.0

Unfortunately the doors are not at all insulated so you hear a lot from the room across the hall.  Rooms are not bad, bathrooms fairly functional.  The pool is 50cm deep at one end so you can’t do laps. You can only swim in circles in the deep end for exercise - but that doesn’t work if there’s anyone else in the pool.  No bathrobes provided in room, nor was the mini bar stocked. Cue management response ‘oh we would have provided them if you had asked’. That’s not the point.

However, within 10 seconds I figured out that the swimmable part is only 8 meters long, before the whole pool quickly becomes less than half a meter deep. A ramp goes up to the surface, across the entire pool, which makes swimming laps impossible! Great for kids to play in. Useless for anyone to actually swim in.

Upon arrival, reception was very busy - as often us with large city hotels. However this led to complete confusion on the desk, as some people had arrived earlier than others. At one point they thought they hadn't got enough rooms for us, then payment became complicated as one person had paid the deposit - who then had to pay for each room individually and get an individual refund on the deposit - very strange.  Upon returning to the hotel for the night out, again confusion at the desk ruled, with the wrong key cards being issued. Key cards no longer working- and at one point it looked as though one of our rooms had been given away so there was no where to stay for some of the group - chaos!!!!

Clean & good location.,"I stayed at this hotel for one night in late November. Check in was fast and easy, and the room was well appointed and very clean. Breakfast was good, and the pre-booked massage wonderful. The pool was good to take out the kinks caused by the M6 & M1. Parking near the hotel was easy and free at the weekend. The tube is a 10 minute walk away at most, and it's a similar walk to Primrose Hill, which is really nice. Only booking the week before my stay meant that it was fairly expensive, but looking to book in the future, I can get a room for 2/3 of what I paid. My brief interactions with 3 or 4 members of staff were extremely positive. All in all, a very good experience.",Date of stay: November 2012,5.0

Such a nice touch.  He also recommended a great little Italian restaurant about a 5 minute walk away called Luigi's.  It was excellent.  Our room was perfect, nice size for London.

It was a bit tricky to get to on the tube as you almost always had to switch lines to get there, but the value for the price was great.  The area surrounding the hotel seemed very nice.  We arrived earlier than check-in and because our room was not ready yet, the hotel gladly held our luggage at the bell desk, which was great.
