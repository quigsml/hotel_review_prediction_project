Unfortunately this was the worst Premier Inn we have stayed at, and there have been many as it's usually our hotel of choice. Checking in was really slow with the queue stretching out on the pavement outside the hotel, with one employee pulling her hair out trying to come alone. It's a 14 floor hotel with only 2 lifts, one of which seemed constantly on floor 12. The restaurant staff will cancel your evening meal reservation if they are under pressure, but not tell you this until you arrive to be seated, and then lie and insist that you didn't make a booking - this didn't just happen to us, we witnessed other guests with the same issue. You will be glad there is a KFC just down the road. Also don't forget to book breakfast when you check in, or you won't be getting any.…",Date of stay: June 2021,2.0

I was told that Waterloo was a good place to stay and I like the Premier Inn chain so chose this hotel.  Firstly, this was extortionately expensive. It cost over £500 for 3 nights. I could go to Las Vegas for that price! The rooms were like box rooms. Exceptionally tiny. There were only two of us staying in the room but it felt like it was a room for 1. The staff on reception barely spoke so didn’t tell us anything about breakfast. I had paid for breakfast included and no one actually told me that breakfast opened early on the morning of the marathon. This would have been very useful to know.

Much worse was the fact the the hotel plumbing made a horrendous, high-pitched noise very time water was run in the part of the building I was staying. Imagine my ""delight"" when I was woken up by the noise of my neighbour having a 15 minute shower or bath at 4:55am! Check in/check-out was friendly and efficient whilst the evening meal I enjoyed in the restaurant was very good. The hotel stored my overnight bag for me free of charge all day which was great. Overall, however, if your sleep is ruined it rather dominates your experience and I'm afraid, therefore, that this was nowhere near the Premier Inn's usual standard. ",Date of stay: November 2017,3.0

Avoid if you are a vaper.  I only found out after checking-in and going to my room. There was a little sign stating that smoking and vaping was not allowed and that it would set off the smoke sensor (vaping does not).  There is absolutely no reason to ban vaping in hotel rooms.

Although the room was clean and comfortable it lacked light and privacy due to the fact that the window was inward facing and looking straight out to a brick wall on the right side and to the left it looked onto the corridor running past my room because of this I had to keep my curtains closed permanently to have any privacy. Because of the window location there was no natural light coming into the room so I had to keep the room lights on all the time. This made me feel uncomfortable and closed in.

Check in was easy and the staff helped out. I needed to find a dress to go out for a meal and they advised us to go to Piccadilly which was perfect and I found one easily, then we asked how to get to the Hard Rock Cafe and the lady on reception gave us descriptive, easy to understand directions- thank you! Happy hour meant that we could have 2 for 1 drinks, the only issue was that it has to be the same drink and me and my other half don't drink the same- should be cheapest drink free I think, I work in a pub and it works brilliantly!

The main issue was the shower, it made an horrendous squealing noise ever time it was switched on and on one morning we had no hot water at all , although I understand this was a hotel wide problem.

For £130 I expected a little bit more than what we got which was mainly dirty walls, 1 towel between 2 of us (obviously I asked for more, just didn't see the point of having a double room made up for 1 person). The worst part was the view (I've submitted a photo) - a brick wall, and nothing else. If you've seen all the lovely views of the London Eye on the website when you're booking, I'd forget about seeing it while you're staying in this building. Kind of ruined the romance a bit.

Most times of the year the last point wouldn't be necessary, but there were several nights when we did use it, so we were glad we had it!  The location of this hotel cannot be beat.  There is no single hotel in London that will be close to everything, so the key is really to find a hotel that's near a central tube line.  This one has 5 different lines within a 10-minute walk, and getting virtually anywhere in the city was a breeze.

Very efficient and early check in at circa 13:30 - again just what we needed. Staff were all polite and friendly/helpful. Breakfast was excellent value for money and again staff were helpful. I was considering a bit more of a full service hotel such as the Shangri-La at the Shard or the new Intercontinental - but the money would have been wasted given the amount of time we spent at the hotel and to be honest the informality of the Premier Inn brand suits us a lot better.

When the housekeeper arrived she said we could look at 2 other rooms which had twin beds but also facilities for people with disabilities.

You know what you're going to get with a Premier Inn; large, comfy beds, clean rooms, easy checking in and out, pretty comfortable but to pay 165 Pounds for a 1 night stay is a bit ridiculous, especially when compared to the standards we have here in Dubai and the UAE.

We had a family room which was spacious, clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was excellent, but service in the bar was slow caused by too few bar staff. Check-in was chaotic as the machines did not seem to work.  All in all a good hotel at a reasonable rate.",Date of stay: March 2013,4.0

The hotel has only been open for a couple of week and it was clear as everything was finished to an impeccable standard.   The hotel is unique as it is part new build and the other part goes into the old maternity hospital right kept door. The have been very sympathetic towards the history of the building and sow off original features of the building such as the original hallway tiles and they have old pictures of the nurses on the walls.   The thyme restaurant is located on the lower ground floor and has been designed well with a bar area and a dining area.

Nice bar area- we didn't eat so can't comment.  Negatives were - unable to get rooms on same floor - had requested but rooms not assigned until arrival- our kids had adult so not a big issue for us but had we younger kids would be an issue.  -Our room was absolutely freezing-Heating in our room 1110 was turned off on arrival and we figured it was just something we were doing wrong with air con remote next day asked housekeeping and they couldn't get it going so we contacted reception who then turned it on from reception.

The staff were friendly and the rooms clean and comfortable.  Negatives points were the lifts in the morning - we were on the 5th floor (which was incidentally very quiet - no traffic noise at all during the night)  and gave up and walked down to breakfast in the end.  Breakfast was disappointing - we had to queue twice - once to be seated and then again for the buffet breakfast - which was missing items which were either slow to be replenished (fried eggs, mushrooms and white bread) or not there at all (croissants, muffins, berry compote).  The lay out was very poor & I would suggest that the toasters be moved  away from the…",Date of stay: April 2013,4.0

This new hotel is only a few yards from the London Eye and we could walk to the West End, we could not have picked a better location.

Easy access to transport with rail, underground and bus options at your doorstep.  This was our first use of Premier Inn, so not sure what to expect.  the rooms were comfortable to use as a place to sleep at the end of the day, but not limited space to spend any more time inside.  The bed was not to my personal liking as it was quite hard, and led to some interrupted sleep.  Breakfast in the basement was quite pleasant.  The second morning there was a long queue with people waiting for hot food options, which would suggest the buffet layout could be improved.

Brilliant location to Westminster and key tourist attractions. Great friendly staff throughout hotel. Basic, but enjoyable breakfast.  One or two suggestions: move the tea, coffee, juice station way from the kitchen door  ensure staff replenish hot food trays when existing tray is 2/3 empty .... this will help reduce waiting time and lines in busy times.
