The film-themed decor injected personality into the chain hotel format and the building itself has a quirky style.  Breakfast is continental buffet style which was served packaged to make it as Covid safe as possible. Hot baguettes could be purchased.  Rooms were clean and comfortable and, in spite of the main road, very quiet. I thought the shower was useless but on second use realised you had to click over to get to the more powerful setting - shower tip for you!  Compared to central London prices this place is a steal.  Ealing itself has a lot to offer with numerous restaurants, parks and shops within walking distance of this hotel but with great travel connections into central London or to attractions such as Kew Gardens.  We parked at the Arden Road car park which is run by Ealing Council.  It wasn’t too bad on a weekend although we did take the last space on our return on Saturday evening.  Staff were polite and friendly and the hotel seemed very well set up to deal with the current pandemic situation - hand sanitiser accessible everywhere - lots of visible cleaning and rooms immaculate.…",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

For example:  -They know people don't really need a phone in a hotel room anymore, so there isn't one. Makes sense. A card says if you need anything, get with staff on What's App ... but I don't use What's App.  -To save energy, you have to plug your card in to a slot to activate the room lights (idea is you take your card out when you leave and thus the lights go out).

Breakfast was basic but fine, just as expected, no complaints .  This looks like a lovely hotel, and very convenient for me to visit family, but a bit closer inspection the room wasn’t that clean.  The bathroom floor is a non slip tile which is safe, but had lots of things stuck on it. The bedroom has a busy carpet which also could hide the things still stuck on it.  I don’t usually go looking for things to complain about, but I drop something, and on picking it up had to look under the bed. There was rubbish not mine, if the bed has space underneath then keep it clean.  I think you should wear slippers and you would be fine, in bare feet you can feel things sticking to them.

Seems all style and no substance though.  Room was very basic, but also very clean. Reasonable night's sleep and comfy bed. No frills whatsoever. Enough tea/coffee in room for one cup each (if a couple). One small towel each. A lack lustre shower.   Breakfast is a poor attempt at continental.   Nothing hot, not even a boiled egg.  Ham, cheese, bread and some tinned grapefruit or a small croissant...… that's it.  Staff were great, very friendly and helpful.

The hotel had air con throughout and lovely décor that made you feel like you were not in a hotel and you were special. The breakfast was continental which is enough for me and still fresh and stocked up until last minute breakfast lovers come down. The décor just is something to start a good old conversation over film references all around it is lovely and I just hope it stays the same in years to come. 5-10 minute walk from the train station but a half an hour trip into the centre of London and 5 minutes from a big shopping centre was great location for us.

It was advertised as one double and two single beds, but it was one double and one sofa bed. It wasnt a problem, since only one kid stayed in room. The room was large enough and quite stylish compared  to other ibis hotels. The family rooms were facing to the front road, but no annoying noise at all. The double rooms are facing to the side buildings.  Personel was fantastic, very friendly.  The breakfast was just ok, no eggs at all, even boiled ones. Just one type fruit. And breakfast serving area is too small.  Location- wise depends on where you are heading. You can walk to Ealing station in 10-12 minutes or take the local bus, just 3 stops.

As a loyal Accor customer (with 4 years Platinum status) I’ve never had a worse experience.   First impressions were bad - no reception desk, just a large red table which looked more like a promotion for a charity collection. Near the table was a scruffily dressed young men wearing a T shirt which said “Cereal Killers” on it. Having been completely ignored by him it eventually transpired that he was the receptionist. It wa difficult to check in due to communication difficulties caused by the over loud music. Having been given my payment card back while his back was towards me, he then walked off saying something inaudible, to the rear of the hotel.

I’ve been waiting to try this newly opened addition to the brand’s portfolio in London which I understand was badly delayed following a fire during construction.  Let’s start with the plus points:  • it’s in a good location about 5-10 minutes’ walk from Ealing Broadway tube, and all the shopping and restaurants in the area. There are also are bus stops right outside.  • the hotel has a quirky movie theme reflecting the area’s comedy film heritage (hence the title of my review) • the staff and management I spoke to were courteous and professional in the extreme, and dealt admirably with a number of problems I experienced.
