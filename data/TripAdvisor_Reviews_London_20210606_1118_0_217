It is the staff.  Sadly, my experience of the staff is that simply do not care, no are they interested in any concerns or complaints you may express.  I have noted that this has been commented on before.  So I would have to agree 100% with those reviews.  Do not expect any response to emails send with specific requests as you will not receive one.  So a  hotel with a good location is irrelevant when there is no heart beat or passion within the hotel.

Had been out since March 8th and when we left on the 21 was still down.  The stairwells were wide enough for one person and very steep.  No attempt was made to advise us ahead of time, nor to compensate for this in any way.

Rooms are small, but clean and nice.  The Asian woman supervising breakfast is hovering like a hawk above the guests. Not very welcoming or friendly. All business.  The girls serving and attending at breakfast look very not-motivated, and are almost being treated as slaves by the Asian woman. Please, Norfolk Towers, motivate people and don't let a woman like this ruin your good atmosphere.",Date of stay: March 2017,3.0

The first thing that strikes you is how incredibly friendly the staff are. They do everything with a smile.  The food is so tasty and very reasonable priced. And then me and my sister sat in their bar at happy hour and had the best cocktails ever! Singapore sling, pina colada, White Russian and a blue Hawaii. By that time we was very merry so up to our room we went. If I had to say one teeny negative is that the bathroom is a bit snug, But I'm quite shapely so perhaps it would be snug for anyone else.

We chose the place as it was one of the cheapest we found on booking.com and the reviews were ok.   The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Paddington, right by St Mary's hospital. The lobby is very bright and clean and the staff were welcoming.   Our room was quite small, and would have been too small if we were staying for a week, but for one night it was perfect. The bathroom was again very small but the shower was a nice overhead.   A continental breakfast was included, with an English available for an extra £4.95pp. There were plenty of staff on hand and I had coffee served very quickly.

This is in a good location, only 5 minutes walk from Paddington and easy to find. Lots of cafes, shops and fast food/restaurants nearby.  Hotel staff were friendly on reception and a gentleman took our bags to the room.  After waiting over 5 minutes for the lift we took the stairs. This happened the next day so we didn't bother with lift again.   Rooms were clean, small bathroom which was a little tricky getting in an out of due to the door being close to the sink.

The room and bathroom were all refurbished, lovely furnishings and comfy bed. Unfortunately the reason I have given a 3 out of 5 is because although the hotel is clearly 4 star standard, we felt the breakfast and breakfast service weren't. The maître d was very stern and unapproachable and there seemed to be no sort of system in place. We were allocated a table and it was given to another couple when we went to get our breakfast,  the tea we ordered was also taken to the wrong table and we had to wait a while for it. We weren't too bothered about this really but the breakfast we got ourselves from the buffet was also very cold.
