On entry into the hotel there's a unit of information pamphlets about What's on & Where to go with sanitizers available before you walk around the corner to the reception desk situated in the large seating area with a business centre at one end and the dining area at the other. The business centre had a homely feel as there was a large central table with armchairs, book shelves, newspaper rack, ornaments, pictures, side tables, bar stools, PCs & fax/printers with an ornate room divide separating the business centre from the lounge section of the reception. Opposite the lounge section of the reception was  a shielded reception desk next to a bar and shop section selling snacks and chocolates. Next to the desk is a wall mounted  screen showing City Airport's flight details & times.At the end of the reception was a dining area with a tall stools section,padded cubicles sections and regular tables & chairs. Long carpeted corridors bring you to a good size room. On entry the room was a wide, full size mirror opposite the entrance to the bathroom. As you walk further in there was a side table with tea/coffee facility and a big flat-screen TV above. Then there was a large semi-circular shelf acting as a desk as it had a fancy desk chair and a desk lamp with a large facial mirror above. There was a 2-seater settee with matching foot rest. The standard double bed had a small single corner shelf on one side and a 3 drawer bedside table on the other side which had a safe in 1 of the drawers and a hairdryer in another. There was also built in bedside lights and plugs with USB sockets to charge your phone easily. The air conditioning is easily controlled by a wall mounted control unit. Just before the bathroom was a sliding door with hanging space for clothes and an iron & ironing board. The bathroom had a large double shower with a shower head that had variable jets and dispensers for soap, shampoo & conditioner. There was also a single sink with a large mirror above and a small open shelf unit where towels were kept. The window in the room was full length from floor to ceiling giving great natural light but the  view was only of the main A roads and dock area. There was a Fitness centre but due to COVID it was closed. Snacks were available 24hrs a day like pizza, jacket potatoes, soup, panini & nachos. Also there was a dinner menu with starters, mains & desserts.

The staff were pleasant and friendly upon check-in.   The room included all the expected amenities, a comfortable bed, flatscreen TV and a hot powerful shower. However it had a somewhat clinical feel with all of the bright white lights and white painted walls.  I was less impressed with the dinner menu (or the lack of), there was a 24 hour snack menu which was pizza, jacket potato and soup. I opted for the pizza, they didn't even have any jalapeños as stated on the menu was an extra topping.  Breakfast was slightly better, with a choice of all of what you would expect.  I also had a meeting room booked for the following day, unfortunately the same 24 hour snack menu applied for lunch.   In summary, this hotel is quite basic, if…",Date of stay: April 2017,2.0

I was unable to checkin digitally. Maddy at reception noted the room I chose online and reserved it for me.  She also informed me that she would be at reception when I arrived and she will ensure a comfortable stay - and she did so each morning with a cheerful greeting and a weather report. My room 712 is a beautiful corner room, with tea/coffee making facilities, clean, crisp linen and a walk-in shower.  The shampoo/conditioner/body wash containers worked a treat on my tired sensitive body.  The location is conveniently accessible from City Airport and Excel.  Reception will order you a taxi to the airport if you have too much luggage and have young children. The waffle maker is a great hit and must be tried with honey…",Date of stay: April 2017,4.0

The hotel is spotless, which i guess you would expect from a brand new hotel but appreciated nonetheless. The gym was great, brand new equipment and a good amount of space. We enjoyed the breakfast - my nephew very much enjoyed the waffle machine as a special treat! Service was very good and the staff were friendly and smiley. If you walk out to the left there is a park within easy walking distance and to the right you can walk along the docks to Excel etc which was very nice in the sunny weather. Limited parking but there is clearly more work to be done, hence the diggers etc so maybe this will change. Yes the view from my room was towards the road but i didn't hear the traffic at all.

The hotel is immaculate, however the staff don't seem to know their own systems yet 1. I called to ask if there was an additional charge for double occupancy of rooms and was told no, when I arrived they said there was and when I queried this they said they'd wave it  2. It took a good 15 minutes to check us in to our pre paid room only to find that they'd told us the incorrect room number 3. Only one of the room cards worked  4. Check out was another unnecessarily long wait 5. I asked them to print a 3 page word document and they didn't know how to do it 6.

I was not greeted as a Hilton Honors Member (Silver) and the room I have been given looks right at the street with few bulldozers facing straight into my room - this is my lovely view and backyard. I have stayed in many other hotels from the chain and usually upper Hilton honors are offered upgrade.   Nevertheless I did not complain but I am now really frustrated because the hotel is not close to any amenities and I asked them for mineral water which is normally given complimentary for Hilton Honors members and the staff at reception told me to drink from the tap!!!
