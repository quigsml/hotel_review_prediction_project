The room we had was a good size with an exceptionally comfy bed and a fab shower. Here come the negative.... don’t have the breakfast. From being shown to our table to having our order taken we waited forty minutes. We’d ordered mixed berries and yoghurt followed by a cooked breakfast. The fruit when it finally arrived looked like it had been chucked into the bowl, no yoghurt came and no cutlery, the lady who brought it to us said I’ll just fetch the yoghurt and cutlery, if we’d waited for her we would still be sat waiting. We eventually attracted another person who went off to get the missing items and he finally returned with the fruit (again) and nothing else. We eventually attracted the attention of the man who had seated us and who seemed to be in charge who didn’t apologise just said that they were very busy who finally got us our yoghurts. The cooked breakfast finally arrived. The poached eggs I think must have been cooked at 5am as the yolks were rocked hard bullet like, the sausages under cooked and again everything looked like it had been chucked on the place. No toast arrived so again we had to ask for that which eventually arrived minus the butter. Our drinks coffee and juice arrived more or less when we were ready to leave, the coffee was stone cold and the juice was tepid. Not a good experience. That was our fist morning at the hotel, we didn’t have breakfast again after being charged just sort of £10 each for what was worth £1.50 at the most. The hotel and most of the staff were good but the food really let this place down a lot.…",Date of stay: June 2021,4.0

It's on a quiet street, but just a 5 min walk from bustling Earl's Court Rd.  I chose it because I was supposed to be going to a show nearby which was cancelled, but it was still handy for everything else I had planned to do in London.  I was there just as Covid-19 started to take hold, so it was unusually quiet, and I had the bar to myself most nights.  I doubt it'd be like that under normal circumstances, but I was happy.  I had the breakfast on one of the mornings, and was quite happy, again mostly due to the lack of crowds, and the food is generally ok.  I really have nothing bad to say about this Premier Inn, and will stay again next time I'm allowed to leave my country.",Date of stay: March 2020,5.0

We couldn't check in until around 6pm because they supposedly didn't have their linen delivery, but they didn't receive it every day we were there so I suspect it was more a lack of staff. We booked in for breakfast on the second morning but had to queue outside the restaurant for 20 minutes while dirty plates piled up on empty tables inside.

Our room was not cleaned properly upon arrival with brown crusty smears across our “freshly cleaned” linens... thank god for extra cleaning precautions during a pandemic. Our neighbours were loud during the night and bought a strong smell of cannabis into the area which reception ignored, but every time we interacted with the night staff they seemed unequipped to deal with our requests.

Anyway, we were told we’d need to wait an hour for the room. Not great when you have two young children, but it seems PremierInn staff were let down.   In fairness the staff were very good.

So after that first use none of my family could use the wash basin for our two night three day visit. We did report it to one of the colleagues on the reception desk on the Saturday night. The guy said maintenance wouldn't do anything until Tuesday and he couldn't move us to another room so we would have to suffer it until checking out the next day, how rude and unconcerned was that!

I stayed in a Premier Plus Room which was well equipped and well worth the extra money. The hotel was extremely clean and the staff were really helpful too.

This was not very pleasant. Regardless, I would definitely stay again - the local area is lovely and is only a short 15-20 minute walk from Kensington and many bars and restaurants.

The duty guy said the hotel was full and there were no other rooms. I advised him that I would need an ambulance if I was not moved and the female duty manager took over. She allocated us a disabled room and we eventually had a good night. The rooms need to be aired before letting customers sleep after decorating as I’m sure I’m not the only one with asthma.

Floor could have done with a vacuum and the table not the cleanest, so I moved. The new table was the same, so back I went!! Ordered a fish cake starter which was lovely, but the “crisp side salad” was a lettuce leaf, brown and seen better days! Main was a burger which was fine.   Went to bed and although the bed was fine, the hotel is directly above a railway line and you do hear the trains, every 20 mins or so! Suppose this can’t be helped for a central hotel.

The hotel was pleasant enough on the ground floor although does look like a converted office building on the outside. The issue really was with the room. I was in room 653 and there was a wooden baton along the bottom of the external wall. it was covered in black mildew and not not very attractive. The chair and desk were wobbly. I stood up from the desk and was holding the side.... so it tipped forward. My biggest complaint was the mattress. I stay in Premier Inn's a lot and always love the bed.

The property was reasonably priced and the kids eat free breakfast was a winner for us with 2 kids (9 and 6) with a nice selection.   The room was not large but enough for us as we were out all day. It was well cleaned daily.   The room had a bath. One thing to note was that the room doesn’t have a fridge which can be a little bit annoying when on a budget for keeping little snacks etc milk for kids etc.   The location was good just a short walk to the tube and bus stops but out of the hustle and bustle. It’s on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow which is handy.   The staff were nice. I would recommend for a short family stay in London if on a budget. ,Date of stay: April 2018,4.0

We stayed for 3 nights last week, the rooms are standard size for London hotels, beds are pretty comfy actually and plenty of spare pillows. I also stayed here last year. Although the room was clean enough, there was damp round the windows and on the ceilings in the bathroom and like I said is really need of a refurb. It falls down for me on practical aspects, such as nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom or no mirror over the dressing table. I appreciate that sort of thing might not bother some but its the sort of thing that I look at.
