I arrived rather tired after a week of travelling and was checked in by the lovely Anjilla who explained what was on offer at the hotel that evening (live DJ at the bar) and did an excellent job of making me feel at home!  The room was huge, though I do find the layout to be a little on the abstract side (sink taking pride of place in the room itself for the some reason), but it was undoubtedly spotless with a fantastic view of the London skyline to boot.  The bar/restaurant had a very classy feel indeed, though I only made use of my welcome drink in there, so couldn't comment on the food offering. Certainly, the plates being handed out to fellow guests looked to be very tasty and well presented.  I would absolutely stay again. This definitely isn't the cheapest hotel in the area, but for the location and quality of the product, it's worth every penny.…",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

The hotel is superb and the staff are brilliant too.  The room was great value for money and the bar restaurant area was outstanding. In these covid times where table service is the way forward the tall guy worked his backside off to make sure your glasses were full and so did the girls behind the bar. Even had some live music by Sam which was very good and quite amusing too…!!! The breakfast was brilliant and even the lady who greeted us was very kind and happy.

The staff is super friendly and made us feel welcome all the time. The room was spacious, clean and offered excellent sleep quality. The location is superb, in my opinion it's walking distance from all the main places of interest in London and obviously very close to tube stations. There is a car park on premise at 26 GBP for 24h (serviced by Ibis hotel next to Novotel). The only thing I think needs an improvement is breakfast - it's OK but comparing to Novotels in other countries it sompares rather poor. Actually the worst scrambled eggs I have experienced. Still the hotel is worth recommending and I will happily stay there again.",Date of stay: July 2018,5.0

The service was lacking. The check in was smooth. But check out was a bit problematic wanting to charge me for a late check out that I was entitled to as a member.

There are cheaper hotels in the neighbourhood that are both better located and better quality but cost less money so I'd opt for these if I were looking again.

Initially had difficulty finding it as we lost our orientation at London Bridge Underground, but this was fine as we got to see some of the Thames waterfront around Southwark. Check-in was fine, although the receptionist was interrupted by a couple of phone calls. Our room was a 'Superior' with queen sized bed and sofabed.  First impressions were great, modern, and functional (mainly to suit the business traveller). However, there were problems in the bathroom.  The shower unit had an odd design, which meant that water seeped through gaps in the door onto the floor, and the shower basin caught water which added to the problem when exiting the shower.  We had to use a couple of towels to soak up the…",Date of stay: July 2005,3.0

There was a Playstation 2 in reception which the children thought was great!  The rooms were fine very clean and the bath and shower were great.  Room service was very quick and the breakfast in the morning was fantastic which was full English or continental.  The hotel was only a short walk from London Bridge station and in a quiet area.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel especially if you are travelling with children and thought it was great value for money. ",Date of stay: June 2005,5.0

Stayed there for three nights in May. It's fantastic value for money, especially considering the general bad quality (and cost) of hotels in London. It's basically a 4-star hotel with budget hotel rates!  The rooms are relatively roomy, superclean (and fresh!) with a queen-size bed, a small sofa, a toilet and a stylish bathroom with shower and bath, plus all the room facilities you need: air conditioning, a safe, tv, ironing board etc etc. The room interior may be a bit too bland for some - you won't find fancy princess beds, designer interior or other luxury hotel features here. Nevertheless, modern.   The (mostly non-British staff's) service…",Date of stay: May 2005,5.0

The modern design of the room means that it seems larger than it is and it is very attractive -- plus we got Walker shortbreads left in the room every day.

The hotel is prodominately used by business people during the week so they have a fantastic offer on the weekend called the great getaway deal. We paid 89 pounds a night for 3 of us with full buffet breakfast. This would have to be the cleanest hotel i have ever stayed in. The rooms were of a good size and very modern. The bathrooms were luxurious and so very clean. The shower is to die for, I have never experienced such a wonderful shower and I have never seen a bath so deep, a great way to relax after a long day sightseeing. The staff were extemely helpful and friendly. The breakfast was delicious with a good selection of food. The location of the hotel is ideal for the traveller.

Such a great hotel for such a great price!!,"I stayed in the Marriott at Canary Wharf on business for 5 days before checking in to the Novotel London City South hotel for the vacation portion of my trip.   I was very impressed with Novotel.  It was clean, the same size as my Marriott room, and had all the same amenities at less than half the cost!! The room had a safe, a mini bar, a separate bath and bathroom, as well as in-room Internet (5 pounds=1 hour) just like at the Marriott (10 pounds = 15 minutes).  The hotel also had a fitness room and shoe polishing machines on every floor -- nice touch.  The difference between the two hotels?  You get a chocolate on your pillow at the Marriott, as well as nicer bed covers.   Is it worth the price differrence?  I paid 80 USD a night for the Novotel through Priceline.com.

Location, south of the river, is great if you want a quiet stay but within easy access of the sights. It is a couple of minutes walk to the embankment and 5 mins from the tube / London Bridge.    Welcome was friendly and efficient and reception staff were able to help answer all our queries.  Rooms had everything you would want and expect of this standard hotel.  Bedrooms were great - bathrooms really stylish with the best hotel shower ever.    Didn't try the breakfast as we got a discounted rate for room only.  Had no problem finding places to eat.

The location is perfect - a few steps from the embankment near the Tate Modern.  Rooms are big, well designed and tasteful.  Breakfast terrific.  Minor problems were the shower glass door failed to keep the water inside the recess at times and the aircon dripped onto the bathroom floor which they tried but failed to rectify twice - although they cleaned up and replaced towels promptly at each complaint.  Good beds.  There is a great $$ deal if you stay 2+ nights incl breakfast.  The staff were extremely helpful, making bookings, giving advice etc. ",Date of stay: January 2005,5.0
