Hotel is in a great location. Felt really safe in terms of covid, lots of cleaning going on in communal areas. All meals need table reservations, even if you've booked and paid for them. We saw a few people turned away due to not booking a timed slot - not sure how as PI email several times to remind you beforehand. It actually made breakfast much more tolerable to my Autistic son, who can find busy eateries overwhelming - it was very relaxing. We stayed for 3 nights and the rooms are not cleaned until you check out, that wasn't an issue to us and reception can give you extra supplies should you need any. As always, the staff were super friendly and welcoming. We'll definitely be back again! …",Date of stay: October 2020,5.0

Just a few minutes to the Blackfriars underground station, we were just a few stops away from the very centre of the city like SOHO, etc, with the neighbourhood we stayed also quite central and lively. Hotel is really clean, the room is large, and the full English breakfast offered is really great. You can find many practical things from toothpaste to some painkillers as well as snacks at the vending machines at the entrance floor. The staff is very kind and helpful. My a few suggestions are: A few more varieties of cheese, beef options for bacon and sausage, little refrigerators and more dedicated space for clothes and luggage in the rooms.…",Date of stay: September 2019,4.0

This was our first stay in a Premier Inn, and when we first arrived we pleasantly surprised by the facilities – it was nicely done up and the rooms, though basic, were functional and comfortable.  That however, was the end of the positives.  We had travelled down to attend the funeral of a friend and had arrived late in the evening, so we were pretty tired and looking to get out heads down for the night to prepare for the next day. Clearly, the reason for our trip and our sombre mood was nothing to do with Premier Inn and not their problem.

Mine are 17 and 15 and pull out beds were spot on. At 17 my daughter shouldn't strictly be in a childs' bed but honestly it really was more than adequate.No birth certs requested at breakfast so £21 for 4 of us was again great value and good quality.

We returned for a second time with family and were all allocated rooms on the first floor. The first night we returned to our room quite late to loud noises from the corridor caused by the plumbing but as it was late we waited for it to stop and eventually drifted off to sleep. In the morning we were woken by the return of the noise which appeared to be caused by hot water being run on the floor. Other members of the family had used earplugs to drown out the noise! When we showered in our bathroom the pipes banged and the shower was nothing more than a hot dribble.

The hotel was a lot busier than some other premier inns we have stayed at though and this was really noticeable at breakfast time which was pretty overcrowded and a lot of queueing involved.  This is not very child friendly because, if your children are small, only one adult can go up at a time to fetch things which means double the queueing time and children getting frustrated with waiting.

Air con worked perfectly and although the hotel is in a very busy part of the City of London there was no noise from outside so much so we slept until 9.30 on a weekday!!

Sadly the restaurant 'manager' on the week I stayed is a jobs worth who is appears unable to organise the workload such that despite there being empty tables I had to wait over thirty minutes for a table at 8.30pm. Pity as the food is fine and serving staff more than acceptable. One person seeking supper with lots of empty tables is not that much of a challenge.

Its very well placed with Blackfriars tube station just 5 mins walk. We took the full breakfast option - which was great-you can have as much as you like and there was a selection to suit all tastes. Just a small issue that it was very busy as many visitors picked the same time to take breakfast at 9am. We had to wait about 15 mins for a table. My advice - go a bit earlier or later!

The prices have gone up, so it's now no longer such a bargain. We now seem to have to pay about £160 for a room rather than the £120 we were paying last year.  There's still no complaints about the hotel side, and the happy hour at the bar remains most welcome. However the food is getting worse in the restaurant.  The service in the restaurant used to be top class, but now they don't seem to care, and can be quite rude. (What's happened to the management in recent week?).

Blackfriars station is two minutes walk and most of the attractions are a short walk St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, London Bridge etc all in all FANTASTIC VALUE FOR THE CENTRE OF LONDON.",Date of stay: February 2016,5.0

However this is a pleasant surprise. It's incredibly clean, quiet (as long as you go for an end of corridor room) and not bad value for its location.

I have now stayed here on 6 occasions (for business)  and each occasion has been as expected.

It was personally my second stay and while I enjoyed my first visit, I didn’t waste time to find another accommodation across London.   Check-in was a bit shaky but it was more due to the hotel chains booking system rather than the hotel itself. Not a big deal, quickly managed by the front desk. Room was comfortable and pretty large for London standard. Breakfast wasn’t included in our rate, but is well worth the £10 charged.  Location is good, with Blackfriars tube/rail station just 2 minutes walk away. Premier Inn Blackfriars will remain for sure my first choice for upcoming stay in London.",Date of stay: August 2014,5.0

I normally don't stay at places such as this and when I do I typically have a different expectation than this place.  The room was generally clean, in good repair, and the bed was comfortable enough.  However, this hotel is certainly not one of the top hotels in London (and I wasn't surprised by this) as the overall ranking of the hotel would suggestion.

The location also means walking distance to all attractions on the South Bank and elsewhere. The hotel is in a rather quiet block and not along a main thoroughfare as some, but even so I guess it could have been noisy and it was not. Being rather new, of course it still looks nice and clean, but here it feels as if they intend to keep it that way too.

The location is very quiet on a night. With it being situated off Fleet Street, a business area, then it tends to be quiet on an evening and weekend, which is something of a pleasure for London. There are quite a few decent old pubs in walking distance which are open all the time. Look out for Ye Olde Chesire Cheese (dont be put off by the alley!), which is a gem. It is also close to St. Paul's, St Paul's tube station and Blackfriars tube station.

It is easy to get to any of the major sites from here.  The price is also pretty good.

Once we placed our luggage in the room, we were forced to crawl across the beds to move around - you could not walk in the room.  Additionally, the internet service was a disaster.

The hotel is new and looks grand from the outside. The reception is small but functional. I prefer spacious lobbies in hotels but I can't complain as the staff here are genuinely helpful & willing to help. This is rare in London. We selected this hotel purely as the tripadvisor rating was good, and I say they should be in the top 10.  The kids loved the food here especially the breakfast. The underground is just across the road but I would rather recommend the buses at Fleet Street which get you through the heart of london's west end in minutes. A taxi to the west end was less than 10 pounds. Only downside is they don't have a carpark, and the nearest one is 10 mins walk from the hotel.",Date of stay: March 2013,5.0

This was at 2.15, when we should be able to check in at 2.00. Luckily another staff member called me over and sorted this out within a few minutes.  All the cleaning staff were very polite too.  I was impressed that we could leave our luggage there after we checked out and there didn't seem to be a time limit on how long we left it for.

Situated close by the underground, it is easy to get to main line stations (and economical too if you have an Oyster or Travel card). It is close to Clipper services, although as Black friars is a commuter stop, you will need to board at the Embankment if using the service at weekends. Easy to do though - just get the underground west to the Embankment. It is also only a 15-20 minute walk along the Southbank to the Eye.
