The staff however were really wonderful, and actively went out of their way to make us feel welcome and happy. Najat and Rajah were particularly great with our three year old daughter.

Negative would be that the corridor outside the room was quite noisy and the walls very thin, could hear near doors phone convo word for word.

The first room was a bit narrow, but the second one was very nice. The only issue I had was with the outside noise, specially in the second room (a third floor). The window faced a back alley, and the noise of boxes being moved, empty bottles rattling or breaking, even people swearing, was quite annoying at times, particularly at night or early morning (the noise woke me up a couple of times).   On the other hand I want to thank the staff, specially the concierges. The airline misplaced my luggage and all of the concierges were very helpful keeping me informed of any news on my bag (even after I had checked out) until I finally got it back. Thank you guys!

Maybe 3, considering London as a very expensive city.","10 square meters a hotel room? Really? And 200 EUR per night? Ok. So, I understand that this hotel is in London and it is near Hyde Park. Maybe the price is right for this area, but 10 square meters(in total, with the tiny bathroom), a window through which the wind is blowing because it is not properly maintained  and the poor breakfast, makes me say that this hotel is no way a 4 star hotel. At least, comparable with other hotels  throughout Europe, this one is like a 2, maybe 3 star hotel. And if you want a taxi to Heathrow, they ask for 60 Pounds. You can order online with 26.   With the same money you can go to Ramada or Hilton where the food is way better and the rooms are bigger.

Aesthetically it is nice, not perfect but pleasant, although it has a few rough edges. Lifts that visit every floor on their way up and down, my floor being a decorators workshop and broken fixtures and fittings are but a few concerns. The staff are pleasant but sometimes inefficient. For 3 days in a row I was asked for coffee with breakfast but it never came! The rooms are very small; they have everything you need and are well equipped, but they're not for everyone. The quality of food is of a very high standard; the Malaysian choices they had on the menu were very tasty and breakfast was always good.

The blandness of the polenta was offset by the very garlicky non-root vegetables. I wished I had gone into town... I told the restaurant staff that roasted root vegetables need to be in this dish.
