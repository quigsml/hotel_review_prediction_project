I stayed in Premier Inn, Hampstead numerous times between May 19 and June 5 while my bathroom was being renovated and spent around £400,00. The first visit on the second floor was excellent and my only complaint was that the curtains were very mean in size. The second visit in room 511 was less satisfactory as the room was tired and grubby, but clean.  The final visit on Friday, June 4 was dreadful. Room 502 was next to a cupboard marked Fire Room and there was a constant buzzing noise throughout the night making it very difficult to sleep.In addition, the wifi was totally unpredictable. Reception's (Alessandro) did call Virgin Media and put me on the phone to their help desk who assumed the issue was with my Mac, not the hotel setup! I knew from other people with the same issue that it was a larger issue than just me. When I asked if someone could check the noise next to 502 I was told there were no maintenance people available over the weekend which struck me as ridiculous as a hotel, almost full to capacity, should have some back up. Staff levels seemed low and many appeared stressed and multi-tasking between reception and dining areas. The whole stay was deeply unpleasant and the room was tired and dirty. I live locally and it is really upsetting that a hotel which was once so well-run and sensibly priced has become tatty and badly managed.  When I tried to complain in the morning, other guests were ahead of me in a queue with whole lists of issues.…",Date of stay: June 2021,2.0

However, the rooms... The first night one of our rooms was above 30 degrees. No sleep. Apparently it says on the website that there is no air conditioning, but this is wrong. There is no air conditioning in SOME Rooms, but perfectly working in others. So check before you go you have been given one with working air conditioning. Secondly, don't choose the 5th floor, as there are pumps underneath the baths/showers that are incredibly loud. So if your next door neighbour decides to have a shower at 5 am in the morning, that's it for your night's sleep.  The cushions in the cafe have stuffing coming out of them, and it all looks a bit tired, but clean. So - do come here for the location, but make sure you are in floors 1-3 (fourth floor is probably also disturbed by the loud pumps - better be on the safe side). Then make sure you are in the bedrooms with air conditioning (the rooms that are in line with Haverstock Hill seem to be working ok).  Good luck  …",Date of stay: June 2021,2.0

This is a terrible premier inn. Do not stay here. The paintwork is old and shabby and dirty. The bathroom door doesn’t shut. There are no power sockets by the bed. It’s noisy with the road. But mainly the hotel just looks like some dirty old hotel you’d see in a movie set in Brooklyn in the 80s. I felt so sad seeing tourists staying there and spending their money thinking Hampstead was a nice place to stay in london and more upmarket and getting this shoddy shabby place. My husband and I have stayed in over 20 different premier inns and there is no excuse for this one.

They are reliably comfortable and clean and always well presented. However...... At £158 a night stay (yes with breakfast), this was appalling. I was stuck in the far back, it was advertised as Air Con ( which was a FAN!) the room was outdated, small and the tv was dragged out of someone’s attic. That atmosphere of the room was horrible and I didn’t enjoy my stay at all. This place needs sorting NOW! I’m shocked at how a central premium priced location is in such a state.

The team absolutely brilliant. Food delicious. Great Location.  Couple of minor points.   1. In the room. Not enough plug sockets. Where there we plug sockets very badly placed. Not near the bed. 1 plug socket on floor. The other at the desk. 2 being used by tv and kettle.   With the amount of technology people bring nowadays there should be more plug sockets and better placed as well.  2. Room like a Sauna. Not too sure if AC working. Tried it couldn't seem to get the room cold. Because of this had to open windows. Then too much noise. Not a big issue as only used room to sleep.

Just a few stops away on the underground.  As always for a premier inn the room was very comfortable. Bed heavenly. Blackout curtains a great idea.  Distant view of London Eye and PO Tower out of window.  My only disappointment was the breakfast. I normally LOVE a premier inn breakfast and had been looking forward to it for ages but unfortunately the hot things weren't so hot and the cold fried egg very unappetising. I suppose i should have said something but didn't like to. For £10.50 which is a lot of money for a breakfast more care should be taken to keep food piping hot. ,Date of stay: March 2018,4.0

Disappointing room.,"After a busy day we wanted a quick meal, bed, and breakfast the next day so opted for the 'Meal Deal' One of the two veggie options was already 'off' at 6:30 in the evening. It took nearly two hours to get a meal and pud for two despite there being hardly anybody in the restaurant when we arrived. Atmosphere was spoiled by a protracted argument between a waitress and a neighbouring diner (though she was in the right).  The room was very small with barely room to squeeze in either side of the bed. The toilet rocked (disconcerting) and the fire alarm went off at 01:10. It was swiftly silenced in about ten seconds, presumably well aghead of any attempt to check whether there really was a fire.

Good value for a great location in London. 3. Clean room and a comfortable bed 4. Friendly and helpful staff. These are the reasons that the hotel leans towards 2 stars: 1. Some rooms are extremely small.  One of the three rooms we had was basically filled by the bed. 2.

This time however, there were faults and they were nearly all down to a lack of care and attention.   The water pressure in the shower was a trickle and was simply not enough pressure to even wash my hair!  The fan in the bathroom didn't work and so it steamed up not only the bathroom, but the whole bedroom once the door was open.  I also don't like the idea that everything is nailed to the wall and so there is only liquid soap next to the basin and in the bath and no separate shampoo or conditioned. Also, no tissues and the toilet paper also nailed to the wall.   Finally, we never received our wake-up call!  On the positive side, breakfast was good.",Date of stay: March 2015,3.0

Whilst basic and not very fancy, it does have all the standard facilities you'd need. My room was a little ""cost"", but for one night and on my own. This was not an issue.   I opted for the hotel because it was local to the ParkRun at Hamstead Heath and for that reason the location was great (approx 10-15 mins walk, 0.75 mile).  Similarly, this is very close to the Belsize Park tube station (less than 5 min walk).   There were lots of shops, cafés, etc local to the hotel that I never used, but they looked of a nice standard.
