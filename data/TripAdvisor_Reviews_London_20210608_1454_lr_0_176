They are smiling and helpful. When a male guest started to bother me and my friend they pulled us aside and said that we should let them know if they were bothering us - we’ve never felt so safe at a hostel before. If you have a cough they offer tea, they really care about their customers. Alex was especially kind, he provided many laughs and was the high point of our trip. Hostel is close to shops and different means of transportations. Would recommend this place very highly, especially if you aren’t used to staying in hostels.

We made a reservation for a private room, and they charged us extra (per their policy) for having two people, but then roomed my husband and I in a twin bunk beds.

The most annoying aspect was that the room was not at all sound-proof.

Luckily we were pretty tired and the music was not THAT annoying. The room was relatively clean, but I felt the sheets a bit dirty. The hostel neither offered free towels, nor had available to hire.

Showers are a rush in the morning as there are only three on the ground floor, three on the second and whether there are any on the third is beyond me as I rarely ventured that far. Unless you're out of bad at five in the morning, you're going to be lucky to get a hot shower. Honestly, more than fifty people sleep on the ground floor and they are provided with THREE showers!   When coming out of the restroom on the ground floor (which, mind you, has only ONE toilet and ONE urinal - two more on the second floor, another two or so on the third) I washed my…",Date of stay: June 2011,2.0

Hostel,"Stayed at No 8 hostel for a few days at the beginning of August, the day I got home I became seriously ill and went through 4 weeks of intense antibiotics and IV antibacterial therapy before I finally returned to some state of normal. I'm not sure if it was the mice that ran around constantly, the bugs in all of the rooms.. The fact that the bathrooms are disgusting (even though I saw the staff bleach them twice while I was there) - there are only 3 showers for all the rooms on the left side of the hostel. The beds were worn out and very dirty, the wifi barely worked and some of the people that *live* there are just plain weird. Find somewhere else to stay, seriously. This is mostly a place for people working that can't afford an apartment, not for travelers at all. Not sure…",Date of stay: August 2011,1.0

It was the cheapest option and although it was not so close to the city center, it was easily accessible by underground and buses (including the night ones), with lots of little shops, bistros and a big supermarket nearby. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the whole atmosphere there was very nice. Everything was okay, maybe just the showers could have been a bit cleaner, and the internet connection could have worked better, but all in all i was satisfied with my stay and would definitely return.",Date of stay: August 2011,4.0

It wasn't the cleanest of places and our room's window was right next to a main road so was noisy.  The breakfast was OK.    It's not right in the centre of London but for the price it's not too  bad and I'd probably stay there again.",Date of stay: August 2011,3.0

Booking direct through no. 8 you can avoid booking fees. The secure storage is 1 pound a day, but probably worth it. They are very friendly and worked with us even though our booking wasn't together, they got us into the same room for both nights. Sheets were available, and very clean and warm. Oh, by the way, free WiFi and several computers in the common room.",Date of stay: August 2011,5.0

In my case, my expectations where met, as few as they were.  The check-in time varies depending on what website you was looking at, but in my case it was 1400, despite arriving at 1200, which meant a lot of hanging about with luggage. All I could do was walk up and down the street avoiding the local drunks shouting drink fuelled abuse at each other outside the local library. Eventually I was informed my room was ready and was told where to go. I think a cleaner actually told me where the room was, which was up some stairs.   The room was dark, as a fair few people were still in bed and it took a moment for my…",Date of stay: April 2011,2.0
