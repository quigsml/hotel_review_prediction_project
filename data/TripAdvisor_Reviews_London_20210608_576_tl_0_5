The room was clean, modern and fresh with a fresh scent unlike a lot of other Travelodge Hotels I've stayed in this one has sockets with USB ports either side if the bed. The bathroom was so clean i thought i was the first to use it the shower was amazing  the bed was so comfortable i slept really well. i would defiantly stay here again due to the friendliness of the staff and also the cleanliness aswell as the cost of the room its a real bargain......A big thanks to the staff and well done",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

The complimentary refreshments in the room and in the young Asian staff Mohon was a lovely touch. He made my checkout feel like I never wanted to leave and book another night in ! Lovely company and great personality :) The hotel is close to central and with a bus stop outside and a tube station 2 minutes walk away, it was easy to travel around London.",Date of stay: October 2020,5.0
