It was ideally located and within walking distance of many of the sites. The 2 rooms we had (super rooms) were clean and comfortable and I thought were excellent value for money. The only downsides we encountered was that only one lift was working out of the three (having a pushchair this meant we were waiting around for the lift quite a bit) and on our second night the key card for one of our rooms stopped working. These however were minor issues and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again if we were in London.,Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

All we needed for one night in London after being out all day. Check-in/out was incredibly easy, staff were really friendly and helpful. Only downsides were; the curtains did not block out the sun in the morning. This wasn't an issue for us as we wanted to get up early, but I can imagine if I wanted to sleep in having bright sunlight would have made that difficult. Also, breakfast wasn't the best; however, the breakfast staff were brilliant, and as kids eat free it was a bargain. If it was just me, I might have gone out for breakfast. Great budget option with everything you need.",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

There was quite a large queue at the check in desk upon arrival but there are self check in facilities that we used that gave us a choice of one or two keycards and completed the check in within a minute.  Used the bar area which seemed reasonably priced and had a good selection. Would be nice if there were more comfy areas around to sit to have a drink and relax, but appreciate that probably isn't possible given the space as the bar and restaurant area is one room and the tables are all needed at breakfast as that gets busy. There are water dispensers in the reception and bar areas.  Room was good, we had a standard family room and there was enough room for the 3 of us - it was clean and comfortable.

The location is perfect with a few minute walk to Liverpool Street underground. We were really impressed to find that Travelodge has been updated to the 21st century. The room was spacious, light and perfect for what we needed. We were on the 5th floor and the only let down was the noise outside but it didn't bother us much. The shower is lovely! We stayed the hottest night in June (21st) with a fan in the room and only a sheet on the bed. Previous reviews are moaning about how hot it was - staff cannot control the sun!

The bed was hot on arrival due to sun streaming in between the gappy curtains. The fan was very noisy and completely ineffective as the air was so hot, One member of staff told me the lack of air con was because ""that part of the building is listed"", another told me it was because ""it's not worth the money to install it for a couple of nights a year""!
