We stayed on Wednesday 11th November. We were locked out, despite staff knowing we would be arriving late (we arrived at 23:15). We tried for 15 minutes, in the pouring rain to get in, we called and called and called..no answer and then the door miraculously opened as if by magic. We got to reception to be greeted by the most miserable person we have ever met. No apology, no hello, no nothing just ""gotta reservation?""..as someone who runs a 4 star hotel this guy wouldn't have a job, how he (Asian, 5ft 10ish, black jumper) actually HAS a job I'll never know all I can think is nepotism. I realise we are in London, the land of no manners but we expected more from a 4 star hotel. Anyway, our room was ok, no toiletries, only 1 set of towels (Covid? Who knows), poor tv channels and a non working remote due to our 'Mr. Miserable' host we didn't want to complain incase we made him cry. Nice pillows in the room, I like firm pillows. Breakfast was nice considering and the server Faruk/Faruq was lovely. An asset and a saving grace to our trip, helpful, friendly, welcoming, couldn't do enough for us maybe he could train Mr. Miserable in how to be nice. Our check out was smooth our receptionist asked how our stay was honestly we couldn't be bothered to tell her about our check in and bet she wouldn't have done anything anyway. All in all we wouldn't stay in a holiday Inn again, we have had better service in an Ibis.…",Date of stay: November 2020,2.0
