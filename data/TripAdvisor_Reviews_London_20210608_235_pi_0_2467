It was a good location for my purposes, being within walking distance of attractions like the Cutty Sark and Royal Observatory, as well as being close to a DLR station for when I left. The room was comfortable, had no issues, and was excellent value for money. Due to Covid-19 precautions, cooked breakfast was served by filling in options on a slip; this worked fine. The food quality and speed of service was good, which was also the case when I ate in the Thyme restaurant in the evening.",Date of stay: August 2020,5.0

Upon check in sanitiser was offered and staff greeted in a very friendly manor. Check in was smooth and we even managed to pay for parking which was a bonus. We didn’t manager to have dinner but the menu looked tempting, next time I will make sure I sit down and try some of the food. We did opt for the breakfast, even though it was not a buffet for obvious reasons, I preferred being served directory by the staff. The food was cooked fresh for us and we kept getting top ups of juices/coffee. Even though this is more work for the staff they made it seem effortless and ensure we left enjoying everything.

In recent years, the chain has begun to lower its standards considerably.  A classic example is the In at Greenwich (for which read, Deptford).  My family and I were there for the late May Bank Holiday in 2021.  It was seriously understaffed and the standards of service suffered accordingly.  Check-in was at 2 pm on Monday.  The queue was out the door as there was only one person on reception and the automatic check-in machines were not working (neither were the two vending machines) and the bar was closed.

On the plus side the bed was as comfortable as usual for a Premier Inn, our room was clean and the curtains block out light to help with a good night’s sleep. The hotel was very well located to explore Greenwich and had easy access to the rest of London via nearby Greenwich and Deptford stations. Cleanliness and Covid measures seemed thorough in general. On the downside the aircon was poor and even at full fan speed there was little/no audible fan noise and it made little discernible difference to the room temperature.

We liked the location, Greenwich is a safe neighborhood and  there are many restaurants, pubs, shops around. I think this is very important in London, because  areas like Peckham in which you can find cheaper accommodation seemed really grimy to me ;-)  Centre is reachable easily by DLR, train (10 min. to London Bridge) or double-deckers.

The service was much better than I remember at other Premier Inns (cheerful welcome, easy holding of bags on arrival and departure, easy and tasty meals).

The first room I was given was already  occupied and I walked into a room full of luggage and strewn clothing!  This recent visit was a bit of a mixed bag. We were allocated a disabled room which meant that there was a lot of space but a few disadvantages such as the bath was very narrow and the shower curtain kept wrapping itself round you as you were trying to shower!  It think it would be better to to be warned if they are going to put you in a disabled room.  It certainly wasn't as satisfactory as my previous 'standard' room.
