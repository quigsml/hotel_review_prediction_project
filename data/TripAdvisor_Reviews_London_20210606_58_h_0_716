1,/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195184-Reviews-or0-Hilton_London_Hyde_Park-London_England.html#REVIEWS,Hilton London Hyde Park Hotel Reviews,A return visit after some years!,"Myself and my partner decided to do a little Christmas trip to London and visit the Tutankhamen Exhibit at the Saatchi Gallery & Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park December 2019 and booked here for a nights stay. Many years ago in our early 20s & less experienced hotel wise we stayed here for a few nights over New Years and loved it so this was our first time returning to the hotel now in our mid to late 30s and brought back nice memories from our previous visit all those years ago. Obviously the hotel has now changed in places but we still recognised it. We arrived early and dropped our bags off and the staff were nice and friendly. We went out for the day and upon returning checked in easy enough as I’d already checked in online through my HiltonHonors account. We had a standard room over looking the park (which we found is actually Kensington gardens not Hyde park which is further down the road) and it wasn’t a bad size for London, clean and had everything we needed including a nice en suite and comfy bed. We had lunch at the Aubaine restaurant below the hotel which was nice and served nice mulled wine but I will review more on their own page. Later in the night we returned from Winter Wonderland which as I stated was actually a little further away than we thought as the park over the road isn’t actually Hyde Park but not too far away and beneath the hotel there is actually a tube station which is just so convenient. Upon our return we had a drink in the hotel bar which was pretty quiet, it was nice to sit and have a quiet drink. We had a great nights sleep and shower was good. We didn’t have breakfast at the hotel as there is a road at the side of the hotel that has shops and lots of restaurants and cafes. Hotel wifi is also good. Would recommend we enjoyed our return visit.…",Date of stay: December 2019,5.0

It was not made clear whether I received an upgrade, but I am guessing that I have received a room with a King size bed rather than a double bed.  The room was very dark and it did not have any view (just a small partial-courtyard with another building in the distance).  The Nespresso machine in the room was not working well (one capsule exploded) and while the room itself was clean, I’ve managed to find several long hairs in the bathroom (tiles, floor, however head).  The breakfast was the best part of my stay. It takes place in the restaurant attached to the hotel which is nicely decorated and provides breakfast menus for the guests. The service provided by the waitress was outstanding. The choice of food was really good and the food arrived very quickly.  A late check out benefit was unavailable during my stay as the hotel was fully booked out for the following night. It was disappointing not to receive at least an hour extra. From my experience, Marriott Bonvoy treats its members slightly better – I hold a Gold Status (not the highest tier) and I always receive a 2 pm checkout, even if the hotel is fully booked out, and when the hotels are not fully booked out, sometimes I receive a complimentary 3-4pm checkout (note: Marriott Gold is an upper mid-tier status, unlike the Hilton Diamond status which is the highest status in the Hilton programme).…",Date of stay: May 2021,3.0

The staff at the hotel are friendly, helpful and accommodating. The hotel itself is perfectly located opposite Hyde Park, with Queensway's shops and tube a few moments away. Notting Hill is also walkable from here.   I was upgraded to a nice room overlooking Hyde Park. The room was on the small size but included a large and very comfy double bed - useful for a power nap in between Zoom calls! The bathroom/toilet was even smaller but with a good size shower.   With lockdown restrictions in place, the restaurant was shut but the staff did provide a small takeaway breakfast and the room was equipped with a Nespresso machine and tea/coffee making facilities.   There is no parking at the hotel which is a problem. There is street parking and a few public car parks in the area, but they aren't cheap (and street parking is limited to 4 hours max).

This hotel is quaint in the sense that it is a style throwback to the old days where the building is quite grand and the accommodations are quite frugal. My standard room was tiny, registering at 7.5 square meters in area. The bathroom was easily less than half the size of the main room. The luggage rack and furniture added to the density of the room. One must use caution when moving about the room to avoid bumping elbow and shins.

Well there’s probably two reasons for that opinion (which I don’t necessarily agree with).  First reason. In the UK most of the Hiltons - as are the majority worldwide - are franchises. That explains the difference is standards and presentation of the Hilton Kensington, Hilton Hyde Park and Hilton Paddington. All different owners and the buildings are of varying standards and ages.   Secondly. The Hilton Hyde Park (not to be confused with the Hilton Hilton at Hyde Park which is a 1960s tower next to the Dorchester) is actually a very historic hotel from the 19th Century.

The room was clean, but if you're a woman who needs to use a hair dryer and curling iron, you're out of luck in the bathroom, there are no outlets in there.

Half an hour wait to check in and leave our bags, then another 20 minutes to collect our bags,( which they couldn't find and gave us someone else rucksack) before going to the room.
