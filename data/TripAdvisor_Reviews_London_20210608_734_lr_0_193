We were placed in what we called the ‘basement’ there was no lift so had to go down two flights of stairs. The corridor smelt damp and this was the same in the rooms. The room has damp wet walls, and was cold. The window looked onto payment and walls.  There was a double bed and a single bed. I slept in the single and it was very uncomfortable with only one pillow. There was someone above us that sounded as though they were moving and jumping around constantly until around 2am. At one point we rang reception and they went and told them to keep it down. We heard this since walls and door was so thin. This didn’t stop them, we didn’t sleep much as once they woke above us at 7am we were awake.   It was not worth the money that we spent regardless of the good location. However, even though the accommodation was not up to scratch the men on reception were helpful and pleasant. And could not do more to help.…",Date of stay: March 2020,1.0

Spend your money at somewhere else.,"This hotel has no elevator, so you must carry all your lugages up to the stairs. The stairs are so narrow that there is no enough widths for you and your suitcases. The room is also small and narrow. You can't fully open your suitcase in the room. There is no desk, no any other surfaces to put your belongings. The room does not have 'do not disturb' sign and the cleaner tried to enter the room multiple times when we told him it was not a proper time. The bathroom is blocked by hairs and other stuff. The hot water supply is unstable and the temperature is always not warm enough. The neighborhood nearby is noisy at night. The wifi is weak and slow too.

You can think that place like this one can exist in cities and/or countries that are belong to the third world, with the all respect for these cities and/or countries of course.  I do not accept that hotels like this one with rooms completly dirty, with the carpet in the room full of dusty, where the towels are not changed every day, where the matresses are without the bed net, with the smell of [--] coming up, with humidity for the all day, noising and water that is coming out from the shower and make completly wet the carpet of the room, with the bathroom that can not even exchange for a bathroom but for some thing else,…",Date of stay: April 2007,1.0

We booked two rooms for the group of us. One room had a smelly broken fridge propping the TV up, the other room had stains all over the walls; bundles of wires next to my bed and rat traps set where the TV should have been. To top it off the staff didn't believe I'd paid even though their website automatically charges 1st night (luckily we only stayed for 1 night - otherwise we would've found somewhere else). For about the same price, we stayed in a hotel down the road for the previous nights with great staff, a cooked breakfast and a clean room (the Jesmond Dene hotel) ",Date of stay: August 2005,1.0

We had booked our room via internet and got a confirmation for it. But when we arrived, they told us, that they had booked us into another hotel (not part of the park hotel) for the first night. We had to pay the same price for our room in that hotel (I unfortunately forgot the name of it), but the room was extremely small and quite dirty (the one and only shower too), but we had a nice breakfast next morning at around 8.45. For the following two nights, we could move into Melville House, part of the Park Hotel. The room wasn't great, but for this price and location it was really ok. Next morning we wanted to go for breakfast at around 8.35. We met the manager of that house (?) downstairs and she told us, that…",Date of stay: July 2004,2.0

The neighborhood was incredibly quiet--we never heard a sound from the street and the sounds within the hotel were minimal (we're very light sleepers and had no problem).   The building we were in (called the Albion House--ask for this one!) had just been renovated, so the rooms were perfectly clean, and equipped with all new furniture, a ceiling fan and trouser press.  I couldn't believe the value we got for this price, one of the best places I've stayed.  Oh, and there was a full English breakfast!",None,4.0
