The manager was unable to resolve so we had to be assigned new rooms while having to do without one of our bags which was stuck inside the room - not an ideal situation.  while waiting for the manger to try fix the door we noticed a large open window on the stair case which led to an open rooftop about 5 stories up. I would dread to think of someone coming back drunk and climbing out to the rooftop disturbing the neighbourhood, or worse, risking death. We were awoken several times early in the morning to loud sirens as it seems the hotel lies on a direct route to a nearby busy hospital. So rooms facing onto the road should be avoided if possible.

My room on the top floor (booked as a single) was very small and couldn't have been used by two people - there was no room to step around the bed and no space to sit other than the bed. I was surprised that there was no hairdryer in the room but I guess I should've known as it wasn't specifically mentioned in the description.  The only window could only be opened about 2 inches which doesn't make for great ventilation - I hate to think what this room will be like in the summer. I'm guessing it will resemble a sauna.
