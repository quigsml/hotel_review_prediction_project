The receptionists with whom I had the most contact, Romani and Maged, besides Radu, were very attentive and made arrangements for me to have the best possible lodging. Thank you guys! The hotel is clean and the maid cleaned the room and changed the towels everyday. The accommodations are simple but were adequate to my needs. Especially for a longer stay, it would be more comfortable if the rooms had a minibar, although the hotel provides space in a common refrigerator in the service area. The hotel is very well located, right next to two tube stations, Paddington and Lancaster Gate, several restaurants, services and local shops. I would recommend it and would certainly go back to the hotel. I hope it is soon!…",Date of stay: May 2019,4.0

The Mina House was good in all respects except one -- sleeping. The twin beds were so old that the springs had lost all of their bounce. I woke up with a terrible back ache. But for the price and its close proximity to the Paddington Station, I would probably stay at Mina again. However, next time I would test out the beds and immediately request a better room.

The little refrigerator was rusty.  I wanted to spray bleach in the shower, and the shower head would not stay on the wall.  We had to hold it in our hands to sort of wash off -- like taking a shower with the garden hose.  There are no lifts, and the stairs were steep, so getting luggage to our room was an issue.  The bed frame stuck out beyond the mattress on one bed and my husband kept barking his shin on it.  The hotel was handy to Tube stations and in a nice neighborhood.  OK hotel for younger people and those travelling light.   Next time we will probably spend a little bit more on rooms and upgrade lodgings. ",Date of stay: May 2005,2.0

The location is excellent, right near Paddington Station AND a tube stop with the Central Line.  Our room was small, but what do you expect?  It's EUROPE for crying out loud.

We stayed in room 4, which we found to be spacious (by London room standards), with a comfortable bed and very clean, perhaps new sheets.  The hotel provided extra pillows upon request, which I felt was a ""perk"" I didn't expect for the low price we paid.
