First, I'd like to state that I've been in this hostel for no longer than one one night: check-in at 3pm and checked out at 11am, so this review can be a bit wrong.  ~Staff~ At the reception, I was really welcomed by the lady. Although there was lots of people to check in, she wasn't rude to anyone and really smiled all the time. We could even forget we were tired and stressed of the trip (maybe sick for the transport).  The cleaning lady was not so receptive as her colleague, so I could say the reception was better than the cleaning staff.  ~Building~ This is a very big hostel.

Never go to this place, very unsafe.","People have mentioned the rooms to be cheap. Our double room with shared bathroom cost us 36 pounds a night. Expensive in comparison to our other uk accomodation. The staff were rude, they gave us a key to a room which was already occupied! We opened the door to find the room full of other peoples belongings. The next room they gave us wouldn't open and we had to return the key several times before they coded it to work with the new room. When we returned that afternoon the door wouldn't open and they had to re code it again. The daytime temperature was mid 30's Celsius and every heater was on and couldn't be turned off. Instead they had all the windows left open in the building! The beds are really loud (sounds weird I know) but they are metal springs and they squeak with the…",Date of stay: May 2012,1.0

For this money you get a comfortable albeit squeaky bed for the night, a room situated 2 minutes walk from an underground station and many places to eat (I recommend the Gourmet Burger Bar round the corner) and the opportunity to meet fascinating people from around the world. If you are picky enough to let little things like writing on a few of the walls bother you then you're going to wrong place. While I can't speak for the rest of the rooms, my room (3505) had all the essentials, easy access to the shower and a very nice view. At the end of the day all you're paying for is a place to rest your head at night and you get that plus friendly service and a rare…",Date of stay: April 2012,4.0

The security at the hostel sucks, they have no control with who they are giving out keys to - twice they were close to give me a keycard to the wrong room. Also some of the keys can be used to one than more room.. Maybe thats the reason that we had visit from the police twice during our stay - a mac was stolen from a locked room, and a guy came into our rooms during the nights and stole money.

The bathroom was a disgrace, filthy and as it was shared it seemed to be in constant use by whoever walked via the corridor, urine and tissues on the floor and wasn't cleaned during my time there. The room itself was large, clean and the only furnishing was the bed, nothing else not even a coat hanger. The shower struggled with hot water, and at best it was tepid. Staff were friendly, bed had clean linen. I paid 110 for 4 nights, and to be honest I could have got a 2star hotel with breakfast in earls court for around 140 and less. So.. not so cheap.

My single room was fine - decent size, had a sink for washing, bed was comfy and clean and the location is fantastic. 2 mins from Earls Court tube. I got my room on booking.com for £15. Amazing value for London. Sure, the rooms were basic and my door didn't lock, but the friendly staff would have sorted that problem. All in all, it fulfils it's task as a place to bed down.
