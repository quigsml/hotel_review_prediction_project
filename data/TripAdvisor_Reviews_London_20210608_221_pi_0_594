Needn't have worried as this was up to usual Premier Inn standards.  Our only criticism would be that the restaurant/breakfast area was not big enough to cater for the number of guests while we were there which meant a wait of approx 15 minutes each morning.  This wasn't much of an issue as the staff worked hard to clear tables once vacated and offered coffee/juice whilst you waited. We took advantage of the meal deal on one night and enjoyed a two course meal with drink which gave a good choice of menu and well prepared food.

I understand that this is a new budget hotel and it did seem that way.  It took me around 15 minutes to walk from the nearest train station (Wandsworth Road) straight along Wandsworth Road.  It was a 15 minute walk to the nearest tube station (Clapham Common) when I went into London in the evening.  The hotel is on a significant but not main road so it is worth trying to get a room as high up as possible (it has four floors).  On the plus side, (as with most Premier Inns in my experience), check-in was efficient though one of the two machines was out of order.

I travel a lot for work, and as such have stayed in Premier Inn hotels regularly. They usually offer a consistent simple, clean room and basic, convenient amenities, all at a price that suits.  Unfortunately, the Premier Inn Clapham fell short on this occasion. Now, I believe this is a brand new hotel, and has only been open for a month or so, so the issues I encountered could just be ""snagging"" type faults. But really, the key to the ""chain hotel experience"" is consistency, so in some respects there's no excuse.  I arrived quite late and checked in using the self service kiosk with no problems.
