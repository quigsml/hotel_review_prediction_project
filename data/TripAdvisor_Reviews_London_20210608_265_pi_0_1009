He had booked a family room on the Premier Inn web site in May. He booked a family room making the assumption, which I think any reasonable person would do, that a family room would have more than one bed! None of the paperwork explained what a family room consisted of and neither did the web site explain this. It was only when they arrived at the hotel, checked in and went to the room that they realised that there was only one double bed ( not even 2 singles pushed together as is often the case). There was a sofa in the room but this was not suitable for an adult and was not made up as a bed.

I stayed there for one night when I had lots of guests at my house and needed an extra bed!  Being brand new, everything is spotlessly clean. I am not sure anyone had ever stayed in my bedroom before. The bed and bedding were extremely comfortable, excellent shower. I did not have anything to eat when I was there so could not comment on the food.  I have two negative comments: - Bathroom lighting was absolutely horrendous (of the fluorescent variety) and apart from being wholly unflattering almost gave me a migraine - There is no telephone in the bedroom so you cannot contact reception in case of emergency.

This hotel is quite new so rooms were very modern and clean. The staff were very helpful and friendly, checking in and out was very quick and went smooth. We had breakfast each morning and the kids eat for free, there was a good wide choice on offer for breakfast and this sets you up well for the day ahead. There is a bar with an outdoor patio area which is nice. The location is a little way out of the centre of London, but you can catch the tube to East Putney and then either the number 37 or 337 bus to Wandsworth town hall, it is a 5 minutes walk from the town hall.

It seemed that they had three trainees on when I was there. Or at least people that seemed had never severed anyone before. Whilst all were polite non seemed to be competent in this service area.  There was a child running around picking up cutlery and dancing whist her mother was reading the newspaper on another table.

However - there is no parking at the hotel, despite being above a large Sainsburys which has a huge car park!  The staff are very helpful, and directed my to a NCP a short distance away. This is not too bad if you are well organised and drop off the kids and bags first before driving there, but is not an ideal solution due to the 24 hour limit on parking etc.   If it wasn't for this, I would gladly award 5 stars the staff are brilliant and the food was very good value.",Date of stay: July 2014,4.0
