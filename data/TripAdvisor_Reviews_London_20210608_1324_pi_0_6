We had a family room and the children liked it because they got a bed each rather than having to share a sofa bed.  The hotel was very clean and the staff were really helpful.  We had breakfast in the restaurant attached to the hotel and it was very nice.   There are lots of restaurant nearby along with a Tesco express and Sainsburyâ€™s local.

The reception staff were really friendly and accommodating, much like the breakfast staff at the restaurant across the road - all lovely people.  The hotel itself is in a great location, Southwark tube offers great connectivity to the rest of London and The Cut is a great way to walk into Waterloo. We can recommend the Lord Nelson Pub (5min walk) for alternative decor, Londonâ€™s best burgers and great prices.
