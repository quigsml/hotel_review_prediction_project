Room was well appointed but ignore the whole ‘covid secure’ stickers across the door thing - no deep cleaning here even when you ask for it. Restaurant for breakfast is poor- lack of choice and service which is blamed on covid??! They are open and still accepting paying guests therefore why not operate as such.

While the room was great, comfy beds with a lovely view of Hyde park, the service was less than of adequate quality. Our customer experience at the point of check in was very unpleasant. The receptionist, Maria, first had an attitude and second could not find the reservation and once she did, she merely gave us the room keys  without any explanation of how to get to the room or any information about the location itself, except for trying to upsell the breakfast to us. Once we got to the room, I called housekeeping to ask for extra slippers, which we did not receive. The final straw was finding the room amenities to be not replenished.

Super close to Hyde Park.  Lots of eateries around.  Tour busses stop right outside of the hotel.  Comfortable and clean room.  Coffee machine in the room.  Cons We got the King room and it was one that faces Hyde Park. You are not missing much at all with the view because it was an area of Hyde Park for busses to park and it gets quite noisy even at night with traffic and people.   Breakfast lacks variety.  No help with luggages when we arrived and when we were leaving the hotel. They could have been more attentive with these things.  Overall: Not a bad choice.

Clean and comfortable for short stays,"I stay here often when I need to remain in London overnight.  The rooms are nice enough for business travellers.  The only down side has been the check in time.  Now that Hilton allows you to check in and choose your room online (a great feature!), the convenience is lost when you still have to queue for your key.  This negates the benefit.  However, a big THANK YOU to the concierge, Sunny, who was able to rectify this for me while I was in a long queue and late for an appointment.  Also, Sunny was super helpful when I forgot my amenities!

The beds were comfortable and both nights we had good nights sleep.

They were very accommodating with an early check in (10:00 am) after my red eye flight and a late checkout the next day (1 PM) once I found out my flight was delayed. The concierge offered help on planning the best underground rout to my office and recommended a cute little place for breakfast just a block away - Diana's cafe. I can't say enough about my excitement to find a Nespresso machine in my room. Immediately made me feel like home. Why do other hotels still think drip coffee is acceptable?

Nice views across Hyde Park too if you get a room on a high floor. The bad news is that the reception is a mess but this should be sorted soon enough.

I give them full marks for having a nice, clean, comfortable room and great staff.

OK the hotel is being refurbished so you have make allowances for the less than attractive public areas and the completed bedrooms are acceptable, though very small. However the refurbishment cannot be used for an excuse for the shambolic service served up by scruffy staff. Breakfast is a buffet, which regularly runs out of some items, which you eat on furniture that's seen better days and poorly cleaned tables.  If all you want is a bed then the hotel is OK, but if you want breakfast, use the bar or generally relax in the public areas then look elsewhere.
