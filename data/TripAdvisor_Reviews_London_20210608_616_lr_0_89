The neighbourhood is great for those on a budget- lots of cheap shops etc.  This is where non-millionaire Londoners live.

Location wise it's a bit far out, the bar food fills a whole and the staff were either mildly annoyed all the time or just a bit strange. £50 for 3 nights was ok, but I am sure there are a lot more better stays closer to the city centre and much more better equipped. I wouldn't…",Date of stay: June 2012,2.0

I had booked on the phone the night before and only when i got there they told me they were having a party downstairs till 6 in the morning so i probably would have not been able to sleep. moreover the people in the pub downstairs were very rude and not friendly at all.,Date of stay: November 2011,2.0

However, if you plan to get up at reasonable times then this isn't for you. There are only 4 toilets and 4 showers for approx. 55 guests. The pub downstairs is licensed until 2am on Fridays and Saturdays and 1am on Sundays, with very loud music (when we were there the bar was empty but the barmaid and DJ still refused to turn down the music). If though you are still attracted by the price and location, make sure you don't have room 4 - it has no windows or ventilation and reached 36 degrees Celsius when we were there.",Date of stay: June 2011,1.0

However, the website said it would be 24/7 check in and the building was locked and nobody would let us in.  We had to stay in another hotel that night and when we arrived the next day the manager said he could not afford to keep people all night anymore and unwillingly refunded our money for that night.  The next day when we arrived to stay again he told us that he forgot we were coming back that day and booked our room to someone else (even though we clearly told him what time and day we would be back).  The location is extremely shady and hard to find... even the police told us that it is a bad area.",Date of stay: February 2011,1.0
