He was always there during our 4 days, exactly when needing questions answered.  Ervin was the epitome of the type employee to represent the Marriott product.  Our stay was nice.  Upgraded to top floor with balcony that allowed me to end my evening with a cocktail and cigar while overseeing much of the city.

There is a kitchenette/dining/lounge area and a big Tesco next door for supplies. Compact, but well appointed bedrooms are stylishly finished. The communal bar and breakfast area is pleasant enough and the games room nice. There’s no room service or conventional restaurant on site, though.

Like with any place, there are some flaws and issues (elevators a bit slow for some and cleaning works on an unusual scheduling- causing some confusion) - it didn’t cause any issues for me as I like to take stairs and also don’t mind service schedule they created. But in my view, you can’t really judge a place that is 150£ at the same level as a place that is 250£, for instance. Certainly, if the price was a bit higher, maybe the trade off wouldn’t be there.  Also I read someone complained about parking. It really makes zero sense to bring a car to London, so I can’t comment on that review.

It's the 5 day without Airconditioning during peak summer, very uncomfortable.  This is a new property & it appears that it was commissioned without checking serviceability of the systems.
