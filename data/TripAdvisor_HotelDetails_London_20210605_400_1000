Room was okay but was really the terrace and location that made it good. Few issues that I wasn’t happy with: the fire door which is the entrance to the heather terrace suite gets stuck on floor and does not close on its own the way it’s suppose to, instead it requires force. The terrace light was also not working during my stay which was frustrating as I had booked this room specifically for the terrace but felt I couldn’t use it at night without the light. I rang to report the issues but there was no answer so I had to leave it until the morning. Once I had actually gotten through them in the morning, the man I had spoken to on the phone didn’t seem to understand that having a fire door that is not up to the required standards is not acceptable. Despite the faults, I tired to book again for the 1st August as the hotel I had booked for the following night had cancelled my booking and I was told that the room was already booked even though it was available to book on hotels.com. So I booked the Jacobson Suite instead - big mistake. On booking.com, the room appears to have a private balcony however upon checking it I realised it was a communal balcony area shared by 4 rooms which was not pictured online. This room was inadequate, appeared so much smaller than pictured, and had not been cleaned properly since the previous guest as the floor was dirty and covered in bits. It is not acceptable to not clean the rooms throughly between guests during the COVID-19 pandemic. I refused to stay in that room as a result and had to find and book another last minute in London, and lose out on the money I had spent on that room.

We wait and I start to call the phone, it just rings, but I can hear it not too far away... Its not in the office. After some time the manager rocks up and makes a joke about him just eating. I say ok, but there should be someone there or we should be able to reach someone in case there is an issue because we have been waiting for assistance for  close to 15 minutes. We then tell him  about the heating issue and he says he will get the maintenance guy to fix it and the person should be here within the hour. I leave thinking this will be sorted. An hour has passed. My mom has had to go to the reception. Call and wait. A lady I  found there earlier who seems to run things claims not to understand, claims the rooms are full and then finally decided it's time to call the manager. She calls a million times and my mom finally gets to speak to the manager. This whole time I wasn't getting through either. When my mom speaks to the manager, he hears her bring up the heatimg issue then says she needs to wait for the maintenance guy. He said the same thing over an hour ago. He does not offer her another room or make an alternative arrangement. Instead he says that she can shower cos there is hot water. When my mom asks if this is the norm in terms of how paying customers are treated, he hangs up the phone in her ear. She is staying in a room with no heating for a few hours so that she can head to the airport. It's cold and probably nothing will be done.

Because I wanted to visit sights in the area of The Pear Tree, I checked it out and it did seem to meet the bill being well placed for my purpose and so it was booked and paid for before leaving Australia.  Unfortunately, this did not turn out to be the case. All appeared fine from the outside but that impression changed when entering. The place had a definite tired feel to it in the bar and even the seating was covered in cloths to mask age... There was no real designated dining area and we had to eat with plates on our laps sitting on old cloth covered lounges. The food was average to say the best.  When we arrived they did have the record of our booking but then disputed that it had been paid more than 8 weeks previously (via Expedia). This wasn't sorted until the following morning.  Our room was on the second floor up some very steeps stairs and though difficult for me to navigate due to age with loaded suitcases (no assistance offered) I accepted this as part of what I look for in old pub character.  Our room with modern ensuite was at the front of the building. It was reasonable size but lacked in some aspects.  There were few power points (with requiring a CPAP machine to sleep I need power next to the bed.) The room had no casual chairs or luggage stands. There was one stool but it was broken from its base and unusable. There was good WiFi but no television, bar fridge or telephone. Also the room was very dark with heavy decor and unsuitable lighting for such decor.  Also, once the pub shuts, there is no service available until it reopens the next afternoon - this meant that the room was not serviced at all during our stay.  We have visited the UK now four times over the past 6 years and stayed and eaten at many pubs around the country but I do find this particular pub difficult to recommend for accommodation especially as the cost exceeded AUD$200 per night!…","['English, French, Spanish, Arabic and 1 more']","['81Good for walkersGrade: 81 out of 100', '22Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '7Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']","Free High Speed Internet (WiFi), Bar / lounge, Restaurant, Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly), Highchairs available, Meeting rooms, Non-smoking hotel, Private check-in / check-out, Wine / champagne, Fireplace, Seating area, Bottled water, Coffee / tea maker","#269 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",12,"[7, 1, 1, 3, 0]","{'All languages': 12, 'English': 12}","['£59 - £79 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'United KingdomEnglandLondonHammersmith / Fulham']"

With no reception in the building there was no intervention.   The hammering of the heavy metal door knocker on the thick wooden door echoed around the building, was quite intimidating to be woken to & in a strange environment.

Cerca de parada de tren procedente del aeropuerto de Stansted, donde coges el metro y a tan sólo 1 parada ya llegas a la parada de metro más cercana al hotel (apenas 5 minutos caminando)   Cerca del hotel tienes varios supermercados (lidl el más cercano, menos de 5 minutos) pero también sainsbury, Tesco, fruterías y tiendas de alimentación más pequeñas, así como varios bares y otros locales. Recomendable conocer un poco el barrio más allá del hotel pues es tranquilo pero tiene cierta animación.  Al llegar avisamos por teléfono a la dueña y a pesar de llegar bastante antes de la hora del check in, pudimos ocupar la habitación para dejar las maletas y empezar a preparar la visita a Londres.  La habitación es suficientemente amplia para 2 personas, teniendo una tercera cama que nosotros usamos para dejar cosas y ropa. Aún así hay sitio para dejar las maletas debajo de la cama, varias repisas y estanterías y un pequeño armario donde dejar abrigos y ropa. Hay hervidor de agua con infusiones, café, vasos, tazas y un adaptador de enchufe. En el baño no hay enchufe, pero hay uno próximo a la puerta de entrada por lo que con un cable normal puedes usar el secador, maquina de afeitar u otros aparatos que puedas necesitar, aunque hay que tener la puerta abierta. El baño, siendo de reducido tamaño es suficiente y el agua de la ducha sale a una temperatura perfecta. Te proporcionan varias toallas así como gel de ducha, champú y jabón de manos. La habitación cuenta también con una pequeña nevera donde puedes tener fruta, leche, bebidas, ensaladas u otros productos que utilices. Las camas son cómodas, aunque como es típico en Inglaterra, la habitación no dispone de persianas y las cortinas apenas tapan la luz, por lo que entra luz en la habitación tanto de las farolas como al amanecer. La calle no es especialmente ruidosa, pero si se oyen los coches pasar y si pasan ambulancias o similares pueden despertarte si tienes el sueño ligero. Nosotros con todo lo que caminamos cada día en Londres dormíamos del tirón cada día.  La WiFi funciona perfectamente y rápido.   El desayuno es de 8:30 a 10 horas, con la típica puntualidad británica. Es suficientemente variado, con agua para infusiones, café y chocolate. Jarra de zumo y leche y botellas de agua. Fruta, yogures, embutido, varias clases de pan (tanto de molde como bollos y barra) y bollería así como tomate, pimiento y pepino. También diversos tipos de mermeladas, mantequilla y Nutella. Los dueños preparan el típico English Breakfast de habas, huevos revueltos, salchichas, bacon si lo pides (lo ofrecen) Nosotros pedimos huevos revueltos y nos encantó. Está pendiente de reponer los productos según se van terminando y te sientes muy cómodo y atendido desayunando. El pago del desayuno es en efectivo, no disponen de terminal para pago con tarjeta de crédito, cosa a tener en cuenta. Por 5£ por persona merece mucho la pena cogerlo, salvo que no te cuadre por los horarios. Nosotros el último día no lo cogimos por salir el vuelo muy temprano, pero el resto de días nos vino muy bien para empezar el día con energía para recorrer Londres.  La limpieza de la habitación y del resto de la casa es buena. Tener en cuenta que no dispone de ascensor por lo que tienes que subir las maletas por la escalera (más bien estrecha) si tienes habitación en el piso superior, cosa que puede resultar difícil para gente mayor o si llevas maletas de bastante peso o tamaño.  El único problema que tuvimos durante la estancia fue que el último día no hicieron la habitación no sabemos el motivo pues al día siguiente salimos muy temprano hacia el aeropuerto y no pudimos preguntarlo.  Los dueños son muy amables y hablan un inglés fácil de entender, lo cual es de agradecer para quienes nos cuesta un poco manejarnos en este idioma y siempre están dispuestos a ayudarte en lo que puedas necesitar tanto para la estancia como para la visita a la ciudad. Sin duda, por ubicación, calidad precio y trato repetiriamos estancia si volvemos a Londres. …",[''],"['70Somewhat walkableGrade: 70 out of 100', '126Restaurantswithin 0.75 miles', '8Attractionswithin 0.75 miles']","Free parking, Free High Speed Internet (WiFi), Free breakfast, Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly), Airport transportation, Business Centre with Internet Access, Non-smoking hotel, Family rooms","#392 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",5,"[2, 1, 1, 0, 1]","{'All languages': 5, 'English': 3, 'Spanish': 1, 'Portuguese': 1}","['£47 - £77 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'United KingdomEnglandLondonEast End / East London']"

I rather liked it, but was very surprised (and embarrassed with my guest) by the overall presentation and condition after what I'd seen on the website. Not a good place for tourists looking for a bit a city glamour and service. As it happens, I lucked out with The Distillery: I had no problems and it perfectly served my needs to pop in to the city. However, I noticed immediately what could have gone wrong: the bathroom is not heated, the tiny sink was threatening to clog, the windows don't open, the large double room is on the street side over the pub (I was there on a weekday, so everything was quiet), there were no electrical outlets near the bed or near a mirror (phone charging was inconvenient and I wasn't able style my hair for the event I was attending). While none of these things are bad per se, it's the looming feeling that no one is there to help if something goes wrong. Think of this as a really great hostel and you won't be disappointed.

The bathroom was rather small but had a fantastic heated floor. The window faced the wall of the neighbouring building (literally a couple of feet away) and hence the ""beautiful"" view.

I would like to draw your attention to a number of things which went wrong with my stay, the first being the room, advertised in the website is tea and coffee making facilities. There were none in this room at all. The cleanliness of the room and corridor was also below satisfactory. Chipped wallpaper and paint flecks were all over the floor.   The bathroom situation for room 222 was unacceptable, in the separate loo the light didn’t work and there was water all on the floor. The separate shower room had no hot water in the morning so was unable to take a shower.  The big problem arose in the morning which was incredibly serious. There was nobody at reception and the front door was locked. I was calling for people, I rang the phone number and also was able to go behind the front desk (the coded door to behind reception was unlocked, big security risk?) and walked around the corridors behind reception trying to find somebody. No one was there. In all I spent 15 minutes looking for someone, unsuccessfully.  I went back to look at the revolving door, realised there were bolts that were locking the door in place and unlocked it. I essentially unlocked the hotel which was being unmanned and there was nobody for me to contact or tell this.

I don't mind sharing the bathroom for one day, but I guess that the minimum requirements are cleanliness and hot water. Unfortunately that was not what I found. The bathroom is old and barely clean. Maybe I was unlucky with the other guests, but the toilet flushing was not working very well... Probably that didn't help.... Moreover I had to shower with cold water on the check out day. The water heater was not working ( after a while the warm water was flowing from the tap a red light started blinking for ""flame failure""). I mentioned it to the staff asking for a partial refund for the inconvenience but he told me that he had to speak to the manager and they will contact me about that. After 7 days I haven't heard anything from them. Some days ago I also wrote an email to them, but still no reply.  There's a fridge in the room, that's good, but no hair dryer.

We ended up paying £400 for a hotel as last minute, on top of the £400 we had paid for the apartment. We didn’t get our money back. Booking.com didn’t help at all.

For the price I paid (£37) overall from the 3 days I stayed there I was quite happy with everything.   Checking in is swift, the staff are quite friendly and if you need any help just ask and they are more than happy to help. If you need to shower or intend on using one you can rent out a towel from the front desk for £2 (that’s if you’ve forgotten one or just didn’t pack one ) they also have drinks and snacks at the front desk for a decent price if you don’t want to leave the hostel to grab something little, there are also lockers there but you will need to buy your own lock (preferably one with a code) if you want to use one.   So the rooms... They’re actually pretty good ! The sheets were clean and I really liked the fact that the plug sockets had USB ports so I could charge other gadgets, the bed was pretty comfy for what I was paying and It’s similar to sleeping on a sofa. I bought my own sleeping liner because I wanted some protection just in case the sheets weren’t clean. The first night was a little restless because everyone including myself was getting used to the environment which is understandable. In my dormitory I had 7 other people and I just kept to myself and always made sure that my stuff out the way just to be respectful of others using the room, luckily I didn’t have any weirdos in the room and it was just fellow travellers ! So I was quite happy !   My only complaint about the rooms would be that they were a little cold in the evening, I don’t know if this was just a heating issue or just me but if you have yourself wrapped up and maybe throw on a hoodie you will be absolutely finest  Okay so breakfast it’s pretty simple (obviously) you have cereal, toast etc it’s quite basic but it’s free and I personally had zero complaints at the end of the day it’s a free meal if you really don’t like it you can go get yourself overpriced food from Central London but assuming you’re staying here because you’re on a budget wouldn’t make that much sense now would it ?  If you do want to make yourself meals throughout the day certainly can just make sure that you label stuff clearly and tidy up.   Free wifi is available but it tends to cut out every now and again which is annoying if you’re trying to do something.  The showers were tolerable they weren’t really that hot but It was warm enough to get yourself cleaned up and that’s all that mattered to me.  The nearest tube station is North Lambeth and it takes around 20 mins to get to most places alternatively you can walk but it’s gonna take you double the time. I must say though the location of this hostel being in Waterloo was really convenient as  everything was already on your doorstep   As far as this review goes there’s honestly not that much else to talk about but if you want to try a hostel or you’re looking to save some money then honestly this isn’t a bad choice at all ! I give it a thumbs up and I may consider returning in the future 👌🏼…","['', 'Budget', 'English, French, Russian, Spanish and 6 more']","['91Great for walkersGrade: 91 out of 100', '39Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '11Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']","Free internet, Internet, Free breakfast, Snack bar, 24-hour security, Baggage storage, Non-smoking hotel, 24-hour front desk, Shared kitchen, Housekeeping, Non-smoking rooms","#983 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",349,"[27, 50, 93, 62, 117]","{'All languages': 349, 'English': 173, 'Spanish': 55, 'French': 37}","['£51 - £113 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'london eye hotel london', 'London Eye Hostel', 'United KingdomEnglandLondon', '12']"

Worst decision ever. This was meant to be just a place to sleep overnight but it changed drastically after the first glance.

Once arrived, this was how to say, in a very unsure neighbourhood. The key was left on the notice board upon entrance. We were assigned room 66. This room is on the top floor which is 5th floor with stairs as steep as the hills. If you have a lot of luggage with you, please reconsider as you will not be able to carry it up without hurting yourself.  Once we made it up to the room, the door was so stuck it needed a bit of force just to open up. The room was NOTHING like advertised on booking.com who still have not come back to us about this shocking room.  The room had 2 towels, with no hand towel in the bathroom. The shower was full of limescale and the bathroom door would not open fully. If you are taller than 5”5 you will not be able to sit down on the toilet without bashing your knees. The room was dirty, no cleaning has been done at all. No minimum health and safety standards have been met despite being in a global pandemic.  Quite honestly speaking, it was so awful we booked another room to stay that same night as it was not secure and unhygienic.  Would not be visiting any time soon. Checked the reviews for this place from previous occupants and the damp on all of the walls is still there despite years going by.

The view out our window was lovely.  Although I am not one to write about negative things I feel like I need to. 1) .It was March and VERY cold in our room.  We were told that the hotel heat was regulated outside the hotel and we could not make it warmer.  We asked for additional blankets and we were given a thin one. (see photo) . My husband literally would lay our winter coats over us for warmth each evening. 2) . The washrooms in the photos on TripAdvisor were not similar to the antiquated washrooms which we had.  If you have any problems with mobility such as raising your leg high than I would make sure you did not get our room.  The tub was extremely high to climb over to get in/out of the shower.   3) The breakfast was not what appeared on the website with any type of meats.  It was a very limited spread. Honestly, this was our last leg of our two week trip to England and it kind of left us on a sour note.

Can't recommend this place highly enough.   Other guests were mostly there on business or for school, and the age demographic was older than your average hostel. This also meant it was quiet most of the time--no late-night party people waking you up in the morning's early hours. It is located on a major road, so there are traffic noises through the night, and sirens. The curtains are also thin so if you don't like waking up early because of sunlight, bring a sleeping mask with your earplugs. But inside the hostel itself, very quiet and comfortable.   Bathroom and kitchen facilities were clean and had most things you would need. A grocery store is conveniently right across the street too. Towels are provided upon request.   Getting into the heart of the city is easy: a Tube station is just down the road and takes you directly there in about 20 minutes.

The location is fantastic, being just 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street and really close to Soho, and with this in mind it was surprisingly quiet at night. The apartment was reasonable and quite clean. I was a little nervous about having to text to arrange check-in but our host arrived just in time to meet me so it was all really easy, plus I was delighted we were able to arrange to check out a little later than advertised and leave our luggage in a secure separate room, keeping hold of a set of keys so that we could collect at our convenience.   On the downside, the apartment wasn't as plush or spacious as I'd imagined based on the flattering photos from booking.com. It's fine for two but I wouldn't want to stay here as part of a group of six, especially given how loudly the floorboards creak! It was also fortunate that we were only staying one night and so had small rucksacks, as I really don't know how I'd have coped if travelling with a suitcase to struggle up six steep flights of stairs with no lift!! The check-in arrangements seem very geared towards international travellers, which was a little confusing/off-putting for those of us based in the UK, plus we were disturbed quite earlier in the morning by someone needing to borrow one of our keys. Finally, I was promised I'd be texted a wi-fi code but never received this.  All-in-all I was happy we stayed here, but whether I'd recommend it to others really depends on their needs and stair-climbing abilities!…",[],"['100Great for walkersGrade: 100 out of 100', '447Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '92Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']",,"#479 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",1,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","{'All languages': 1, 'English': 1}","['£191 - £317 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'United KingdomEnglandLondonFitzrovia']"
