Usually go to Maui as we are Brits living in California. We were really pleased to be able to get a reservation here while on a visit home last year. Cannot say enough about how excellent it was. Location was brilliant we walked everywhere or went on the tube. Staff made you feel as if you owned the building, not just a time share owner for one week. There was even a lady who came in just to water the orchid. Can’t say enough about how good it was.",Date of stay: September 2019,5.0

Told them via email and phone I was happy to pay penalty, additional rooms rate etc.  After getting the run around I got a flat no.  I also I ask them what precautions have they done to prevent a potential out break at the hotel.  I didnt get a response. I'm currently stateside and like to avoid a long trip to UK and potentially being quarantined.  I have a pre existing respiratory condition but I guess it doesnt matter for this hotel.  All they wanted was my deposit because I can imagine their business is suffering.    So beware when booking this hotel.  Lesson learned.",Date of stay: March 2020,1.0

This was our first visit to 47 Park Street, and it won't be our last - this is our new favourite place to stay in London.  The location is brilliant, close to Marble Arch in the heart of Mayfair, with all the sights and restaurants close at hand.  Two things marked out the Marriott as special.  Firstly, the room size - we had Room 1, which I think is one of their 'standard' rooms (a 1-bedroom suite); but it was huge, with a very generously-sized living room complete with a dining table for 6.

Stayed in a 1BR flat with kitchen and pull-out couch in living room.  We were promised 2 bathrooms when made reservation through Marriott 800#, but received only 1 upon check-in. First the good points about our stay:  Location in Mayfair is terrific.  Nice neighborhood, Marble Arch tube stop and Oxford Street are short walks.  Marks and Spencer (great place to stock the kitchen) is nearby.  Building is quite impressive, front entrance is secure (with doorman or guard on duty), common area is small but nice. Flat was clean and well kept. Furnishings were of high quality.  Kitchen was was equipped nicely. Now the bad parts -- all ""extras"" are outrageously priced.

I did quite a bit of research on luxury London hotels before I booked, and 47 seemed to promise the space,  location, service, and overall atmosphere we were seeking.  Unfortunately, while the location in Mayfair is great, all other promises were not kept.    The premium suite we occupied was tired (wallpaper peeling, creeking floors, tiny tv's).  Service was just adequate--a call for a cab an hour in advance resulted in our being told when we arrived in the lobby that  the concierge couldn't get a cab--""just go outside and hail one.""  This was a problem because it was raining and the hotel is on a side street.

We occupied the Premium residence. The bedroom, kitchen, bathroom were tiny. The lounge was ok. The bed was terrible, standard USA Marriott quality. The place is starting to look tired and worn. The facilities are not what I would call home from home. The only positive factor was the staff. They are truly wonderful. All round they were polite and tried to do their best without being intrusive. I am just sorry that they have to deal with a property that is starting to look worse for wear.

So when we learned of a 299 GPB flat in Mayfair,  complete with living room and modern, fully-equipped kitchen, we grabbed it.  And it was even better than we expected!  Beautiful stately building, warm and cozy furnishings, all the technology and service you might want, even a welcoming champagne reception by the resident manager.  A comparable suite at a nearby hotel would have cost at least 900 GPB a night.  Having stayed at the Dorchester, Claridges, the RItz and the Savoy, I will return here as my first choice.  We felt like London natives in our own luxury flat. ",Date of stay: October 2006,5.0

This is a jewel among the Marriott properties. Less like a typical hotel, much more of a lovely flat with all the amenities of room service and a particularly warm and dedicated staff.  Our standard one-bedroom suite was beautifully decorated and came with a living room far nicer than mine at home. It also inlcuded a lovely foyer, kitchen and bath. 47 Park Street is a beautiful city-type mansion, and with about 45 rooms far more intimate than those hotels with bustling and cold lobbies.
