Room was small- one Full/Queen? bed and one bunk bed.  We watched the housekeeper change sheets as we waited. The mattress was so gross and flimsy.  We tried not to think about it that night.    The bathroom was a tight squeeze.  Toilet, sink and shower, you can't move and can't quite close the door.  We happen to hit the Europe heatwave of 101F (typically 78F) so visit was miserably hot as there was no air conditioning and we couldn't open the window (it was broken).  Breakfast was okay, but she couldn't keep up the high period time, so lots of waiting around for bread, coffee, etc and even to get a table cleaned off.

Not welcoming at all. My room was in the second floor, with the toilet and shower on the next floor. The first toilet was tiny, barely any space to get to the toilet between the sink. No paper towels to dry hands on, so whoever was in before me had used the toilet roll which was soaking wet.  There was barely enough space in the sink to fill the kettle in my room. I had to plug it in on the floor, the plugs were upside down on the skirting board. No spoon either to stir my drink.  The sink had been cracked or broken and was stuck back together. No lamp shade, so very unpleasant lighting.   I felt unsafe as the key was the only way of locking the door. I would have liked a bolt or even a yale lock. I could hear people walking around all through the night and felt very vulnerable.  The walls, very thin,could hear conversations in then next room.  I didn’t even bother with breakfast. Piles of cardboard boxes around the dining room.  Only one positive, looked like new carpet had been fitted.…",Date of stay: December 2019,1.0

The hotel was undergoing refurbishments which caused minor inconvenience like having to walk on a blanket on the stairs due to paint dropping but the worst part was the strong smell of paint the first night. That night it was impossible to get some sleep but didn't complain because it was already late and we didn't want to eventually move. I would recommend painting the room atleast a day before a guests arrival. I am more than sure this wasn't the case as the smell was unbearable. I had told them my arrival time so quite sure... apart from that the room was spotless, breakfast good although no traditional english breakfast. Only four draws, no wardrobe which is quite ridiculous in a triple room...bathroom tiny. If you're big don't stay here. Good location which is why I may choose it again in the future.…",Date of stay: October 2019,3.0

I booked a twin room with private bathroom as otherwise this was shared. On arrival i was asked for £85 for the room. I advised i thought this had been taken from the card details i provided when booking but the lady said that was just to secure the booking and payment was required. I wish this had been made clearer as i am on a tight budget and this caused a problem.  We were given a key to the hotel and our room. On entering the room it is a very tight space. 2 single beds with a chair jammed between them. A small table would have been nicer. Tv dressing table with hairdryer was good. Shower/toilet very basic. Handwash/shampoo ?? Provided. It is impossible to use the kettle as you cannot fill it up in the sink due to lack of room.  When entering the room there were 3 flies buzzing around but the window was open. Very hard to shut. Also one of the towels had a brown stain as did the plastic cup in the bathroom.  There is a sticker advising to keep the key in the lock for your own security during the night (very reassuring !).  Free breakfast is provided of 2 cereals/toast/croissants/ham cheese/yoghurts and fruit. Orange juice/tea coffee which was ok.  For one night it is ok if you are on a tight budget and happy for very basic accommodation.…,Date of stay: August 2019,2.0

With the window open and the fan on full blast, we were never bothered by the noise.  We only had the breakfast once.  It's food is about the only positive thing you can say about it.  Not worth forcing yourself to be up for and it's not a big deal if you miss it.  The bathrooms were satisfactory.  Nothing to right home about, but clean enough and I never really had to wait for anything.  The stairs are pretty steep and a bit treachourous when walking in wet flip-flops, but that's a minor complaint.  It was nice having the sink in the room making trips…",Date of stay: July 2006,4.0

I was furious by the level of noise some nights, the walls are so thin you can hear people moving and banging around you, and my top window was broken, leaving it unable to shut, therefore hearing any loud noise from outside could not be avoided.  I fthey try and offer you room 201 or 202 DO NOTACCEPT, i got 201 and it was the basement room right next to both the kitchen and reception area, meaning any work in the kitchen was clearly heard which is infuriating at 5am, and also people coming and going at reception was right outside your door, again anger enducing.

As a solo-traveling female, I felt very safe at all times during the five minute walk to Victoria Station.  The staff is very friendly and hospitable.  My room, the shared toilet and shower were all VERY clean.  The rooms are rather small, but manageable.  For breakfast, the choice is continental or traditional.  Continental = corn flakes and toast; Traditional = beans, an egg, and ham; fruit would have been nice to have.  There's no elevator, so be prepared for extensive stairclimbing!  I will definitely stay here again. ",Date of stay: March 2006,4.0

The service was great, except when we first arrived late at night we had to ring several times before we were let in.  The English breakfast was really yummy.  My fiance and I still crave the ham/bacon they served.  There was no bathroom in our room but we never had to wait to get into the communal bathroom/shower.  The room was extremely small but clean.  My biggest complaint was the thin walls.  We were awoken in the middle of the night by a very LOUD couple next door if you know what I mean.  I am an extremely heavy sleeper and that woke me up so that's pretty bad.  The location was wonderful; I couldn't ask for more in that regard!  I always felt very safe in the area.

Suddenly, the ownership had changed and the new owners... well, it was a great disappointment! to say the least... Dirty +++, no service at all, a minimal continental breafast...

We had 2 rooms, a quad with a shower and a triple en suite.  Though both rooms were very small the beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean.  The shared bathrooms and showers were extremely clean as well.  The included breakfast was okay-it couldn't have been too bad my kids ate it!

This hotel is not a bargain. Look elsewhere unless you do not care about basic amenities.",None,1.0
