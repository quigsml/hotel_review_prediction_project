I need not have been. The rooms are not huge; but they are very modern and comfortable and no smaller than other hotels in London. The air conditioning worked really well. I liked the idea of free snacks in the room and the fact there was a fridge to store them in. Also one of the few hotels that has adequate lighting for reading! Added to that the location is great and the staff could not be more pleasant. Will definitely be back ,Date of stay: August 2020,5.0

Upon arrival we received a surly welcome which set the tone of the whole stay really.   The room was small which I expected, but the towels seemed to be shrunk down to fit the size of the room, you couldn’t wrap it round you. The pillow was also of poor quality, small and extremely flimsy. The mattress was rock hard but I actually had a good sleep.   The shower in the bathroom is very tight, if you’re big you’ll struggle in it. The worst bit about our room was the bathroom tiles, they weren’t even grouted down and they moved when you walked on them. Never seen anything like that before in a hotel. The hotel is very tired.

No wardrobe provided, no breakfast facilities. Water was leaking from the ceiling in several places, dropping from the lights!!!!! It caused a big smelly stain on the carpet so room had a dumpy smell. Shower handle was falling off, water flooded the bathroom because of the blockage in the shower. Very unprofessional receptionist, middle aged woman with black hair (I think Russian or Polish) was talking on the phone in tongue language. When complaint about the leak I had to use very basic phrases as she struggled to understand complex sentences in English. Stayed for 2 nights. When checking out in the night time by mistake pressed the button -1 on the lift where after the doors opened was…",Date of stay: August 2015,1.0

Location: right there, in the City. Service: employees very nice. Room: been given a room in the basement that is not what I booked. Not even finished yet, with tape covering furniture. No towels. In the basement: to much noise, like being in a cage. No wifi. Got another room the second day, but was super tiny and not very clean. They are a brand new hotel and they have margin for improvement. For sure: they need to have better price for what they  offer. Not worth it.",Date of stay: June 2015,3.0
