Both normal and superrooms are perfect for a short stay in London.  The hotel is ideally located across the road from Marylebone Station, and the underground station running the Bakerloo Line.  The reception is 24/7, staff are friendly, welcoming and always happy to help.   Their is lift access to the hotel. Towels, toiletries, hairdryer, iron and tea/coffee making facilities are all included in the room. There is a good sized flatscreen television with free view channels.  Hotel is secure. Access to hotel after 10pm via your room card. Taxi ranks are located outside the train station too.   Plenty of amenities such as bars, restaurants and shops are all within walking distances and around a 10-15 minute walk to Madame Tussaud‚Äôs.   There is no restaurant in the travelodge, but it is connected to a lovely restaurant which has breakfast, lunch and dinner options called NYC only next door which guests can use.   Absolutely perfect for a short stay in London. Basic but has all you need for a hotel room.  Nesh and all the reception are super lovely and always willing to help. Had a blocked sink which he attempted to fix. When unable to he had maintenance out to fix the problem and changed us rooms.    Covid restrictions will mean the hotel may have slight changes in operations which is updated regularly on travelodges website.   I definitely recommend Travelodge Marylebone for short stays either as a single traveller or friends... will visit again! üòä‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2020,4.0

We were on a budget (and therefore couldn't afford the crazy prices for some more central hotels) but this Travelodge turned out to be spot on. It is just outside Marylebone tube station so we were within a 2 min walk to the Bakerloo Line and could get anywhere in London very easily. The hotel itself is very clean and well kept. It was very quiet and the staff were extremely helpful and stored our luggage for our final day there (someone thought getting a 10pm train back to Newcastle on a Friday night was a good idea).,Date of stay: April 2017,4.0

It wasn't a massive room but it had enough space for two of us to be able to store our things. The bathroom was nice and clean and there were enough towels to last overnight. The hotel is right over the road from Marylebone station and a short walk to an underground station where we got the train to the natural history museum so that was convenient. It took about 20/25 minutes to walk to oxford street which wasn't too bad but I wouldn't recommend it for someone older. It's also just a short walk to Madame Tussaud's. The staff were helpful and allowed us to keep our bags at the hotel both before and after we checked out which was very helpful. I'd stay here again.,Date of stay: November 2016,4.0

The shower was not high enough for me to stand under it and I do not consider mysef a giant (abou 1.80 m tall). Rooms soundproofing seemed good. Some details that I found quite annoying are the free wi-fi only for 30 minutes every 24 hours and only about 12-15 TV and radio channels available (not even all the free to air UK TV channels let alone any international one).

There was no warning from staff about this and no answer when I called reception (from my mobile as there is no phone in the rooms). When I checked out there was a queue of complaining guests and one poor receptionist left to deal with this everything, with no managers around at all.

But based on other reviews and the fact that this hotel has literally just completed its interior renovation, I gave it a try.   You can't fault the location, right next door to the Marylebone train station. There is some inevitable street noise which you could hear even with the double glazing.   The two receptionists were very personable and humorous,  so check in was a very welcoming experience.   I'd pre-booked one of the breakfast boxes. I hadn't expected to be offered/given this on check in; and noticed them all stacked up in the back room. With milk and yogurt in them, I'd have preferred them to have been refrigerated‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2014,4.0

Shortly before arriving we were informed that they were not doing breakfast and that we would get a refund. What sort of hotel does not do breakfast? What sort of hotel agrees a contract with payment in advance and then cancels the agreement? We are not at all happy. The best the hotel have offered is a refund of the breakfast with no compensation offered at all. What's more they say the refund will follow in 7-10 days. They took my money quick enough. why does it take them 10 days to refund. I am considering legal action for breach of contract!,Date of stay: March 2014,2.0

What spoilt our stay was a female member of staff.  She was on reception, we arrived about 11.45 & asked if we could leave our bags until later in the day.  A very definite ""no"". ""We don't have a room, there is no space anywhere"".  We asked what we should do & she said go to Victoria or Paddington as they have left luggage.  We were amazed by the lack of understanding & the unwillingness to help.  Eventually I asked if there was a room already available to store the cases & she reluctantly said we could pay for an early check in.  We paid the ¬£10 in cask but had to ask for a receipt. We spoke to other staff‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2014,1.0

Location to Travelodge was within walking distance which was good. And over the road from Marylebone Station which was even better. Unfortunately they were do a refurb of the hotel whilst staying there, so reception and landing were being painted, you had to watch where you were walking and the smell of paint was quite strong. This could not be helped. Rooms were nice and clean, bathroom fresh and nice. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was value for money, plenty of choice, though I felt the kitchen staff could have maybe smiled a little. Looked very miserable. Overall not a bad stay at all.
