This was my second stay at the Four Seasons Hotel and yet again I was extremely impressed. I was here for business and it is round the corner from both Baker Street tube station and Marylebone tube and rail station. Ideal location.  The hotel rooms whilst not huge, were still modern and well furnished, with all the common amenities provided. The bathrooms were also modern and clean.  Service was also good, whenever I needed something a quick call to reception was all it took. And they were happy to bend over backwards when I needed a late checkout.

Our room was subterranian and, other than a sky light, there were no windows. The room, although recently refurbished, was like a shoe box and there were no emergency exits. When we asked for a few additional towels they were unaccomodating. Lastly, they were going to try to find a phone for the room, but when we came back from the theatre we found they were unsuccessful. We moved out the following day to find more hospitable accomodations. The room wasn't even a bargain, we paid good money for this 3 star hotel.",None,2.0
