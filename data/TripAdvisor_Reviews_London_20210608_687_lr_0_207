The owners and staff were lovely and even gave me a room upgrade free of charge. Continental breakfast was included, but the best part was definitely its location. Right in the heart of London, the West end, Central, City of London or even South of London was all within easy walking distance and made my visit to the city 10x less stressful, as I didn't have the hassle of planning travel routes etc.  Definitely would recommend a stay here if you're new to London and would like to do some solo traveling!

My name is Cezar, I had a pleasant experience staying at Hotel Strand Continental.  The hotel is run by a family business. The members of the family encountered are polite, genuine, and helpful, soon I got to know them to be good people, humble and generous.   I completed my booking without problems and I received a special discounted rate for any further stay.   While staying there I met a lot of interesting people and we exchanged a lot of ideas, it made me welcome.  Very good continental breakfast is provided.  During the day I spent most of my time in the communal area where I appreciated the ambiance and learned about the rich history of the Hotel.  At lunch and dinner time Staff always helped me with the dishes, warmed up my food, and kept it in the fridge.  I had very positive and harmonious interactions.  The family's charisma and optimism genuinely surprised me.  I am looking forward to staying there again because everybody is friendly, even the cleaner with their hard work to keep the Hostel clean and God bless their lives for doing a great job.   I wish you all the best.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2021,5.0

I found Hotel Strand Contintenal and it provided exactly that. Also the staff was very helpful with everything.  The beds were clean and on each floor there is a shower and wc. The lounge room on first floor we could use free wi-fi and have our group meetings. This fantastic location made it possible for us to skip using the tube, we walked everywhere. We will definitely stay there again next year.  But...for family people or people looking for high cleanliness and rooms with space maybe this is not the first choice. Also there are a lot of stairs so if you have bad feets then at least make sure you have a room on the lowest floor.",Date of stay: June 2011,3.0

I did not require much more than a bed to get a little bit of sleep and a bathroom to wash my face. I found the Strand Continental as it had the most convenient location in the very centre of London. After reading the awful reviews I searched some other hostels but they had equally horrible reviews. I then decided that I would go for it and have the most horrible hostel experience in my life so that I can stay away from hostels from then on. I even chose a three-bed dorm.   To my suprise, it was not as bad. I got a good night sleep, did not get robbed by flatmates and the toilets and washbasins were not revolting.

Kettle was there but no plug anywhere near the cupboards etc so had to hold kettle whilst it boiled over the bed! (plug by bed). Walls like paper - could hear people in next room talking and doors have a very noisy bang when they shut!
