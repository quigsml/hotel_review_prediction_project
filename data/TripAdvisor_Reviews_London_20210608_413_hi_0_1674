As I had booked my hotel on Hotels.com and searched for hotels where parking was included I made my reservation thinking that I had already paid for everything for my one night stay.  Sadly I was mistaken !  When I arrived to book in I was told by the receptionist that I had to pay ¬£45 to park and sadly I had no option but to pay.  Then imagine both the insult and surprise when I entered the car park only to find that on the wall they had a list of parking charges and that I had actually been overcharged given that I was going to be there for less than 24 hours !  Holiday Inn London - I think that the General manager needs to revise how guests are charged and only charge for the time they actually use the car park rather than automatically change for 24 hours - and also update your information on the Hotels.com website to show that you do not have FREE parking.  I won't be staying here again !‚Ä¶",Date of stay: May 2021,2.0

We chose to have a bank holiday weekend away in London and booked the hotel again. We arrived at about 12pm to drop the bags off knowing check in wasn‚Äôt until 3pm. At about 6pm we returned to the hotel to check in and relax, we had to wait in a queue and when served were told the room wasn‚Äôt ready and to come back in 20 minutes. Returned half an hour later to be told the same thing by a different person. This went on and on until about half past 9! No one at the hotel could tell us why the room wasn‚Äôt ready and when I tried to phone IHG customer service they didn‚Äôt even know what time it was in London! I asked reception what would happen if it got to 11pm and we still didn‚Äôt have a room and was told ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù by this point we had enough and told them to cancel the room and had to pay nearly double to stay in a novetel. The only thing we were offered was a free drinks voucher for the bar and to use the swimming pool changing room to get changed for dinner. I received an email from management at the hotel apologising for the mistake but still not offered any explanation as to why rooms weren‚Äôt ready.

It's not worth the hassle,They have clearly not prepared for return to normality after covid. The check in queue was ridiculous. We waited over an hour to check in and they don't have enough people on front desk so there's a queue always (even after 11pm at night). No one answers the phone if you try to dial reception or housekeeping.  We had two issues with our room and both times had to go queue downstairs just to speak to someone.  They've run out a half their menu at the bar and most of their employees just seem fed up.  One lady at the bar even told us that she had to take payment for the drinks right away because two other groups today had run off without paying. Real classy clientele clearly!

Whilst in London, I thought I would give this place a shot, especially seeing as they touted the recent updates.   Check in wasn‚Äôt exactly a seamless process. The person checking me in wasn‚Äôt the friendliest or most welcoming. Forget about being an IHG rewards member, this doesn‚Äôt get you much at this hotel.   The other support staff (with the exception of the front desk) were great. The location is pretty decent and easy to get to. As far as the room goes, this is probably the smallest room I have ever seen. The bathroom was missing supplies, and the bathroom door didn‚Äôt shut fully. I suggest someone gets a discount from the renovation effort.   Thankfully I was only here for a couple of days.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: October 2018,2.0

It's a 2 minute walk to Kensington High Street tube station which is ideal (on the circle line) and although there's not much going in around the area it's great for getting to central London. On the walk up the hotel doesn't look particularly inviting however as soon as you're greeted by the doorman and head inside it's much nicer than any Holiday Inn I've been in!

I had booked 4 twin rooms and a single several months in advance for a group of us from work who were attending a function. Check in is advertised as from 3pm so when we arrived at 3.40pm I didn't anticipate the check in issues we faced. By chance I noticed one of our colleagues had been allocated a king room instead of a twin as he signed for it.  I checked and sure enough the three that had been allocated at that point were doubles not twins.  I explained my booking and showed the receptionist the confirmation I had printed off.

Initially the room we were given wasn't right, as we had booked a twin and it was a double, and it was also ridiculously small. I called reception from the room as we were really not happy. I have to say following the call a very professional and lovely member of staff, Guilia came to our room and gave us some options in terms of resolving the situation. We were going out for afternoon anyway so Guilia said leave it with her and she would find a twin room and get our luggage to the room.
