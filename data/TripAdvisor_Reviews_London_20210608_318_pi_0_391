Despite the fact that the staff knew that the system wasn’t issuing your room keys there was nobody on hand and the call buzzer was in the bar rather than in the office which is located right by the checking in terminals.  Thus after trying, unsuccessfully 3 times, to raise assistance from the bar I took to banging on the office door.  Someone had to accompany us to our room to give us access which also meant that when we returned later in the evening we would need another member of staff to let us into our room.  When we left the hotel to go out a little while later the reception area was rammed with guests trying to check in which meant that social distancing was impossible.  There was also a faulty light switch to one of the bedside lights which was only discovered late at night, not at a time you really want to call someone from reception, we notified them the next morning on departure  The one plus was that the rooms were well insulated against road noise and the air con worked silently. Considering that this is a fairly new hotel the issues experienced were disappointing.…",Date of stay: May 2021,3.0

They are doing all they can to keep everyone safe during the Covid crisis. Hand gel everywhere and tables waited on for breakfast.  The only downside when staying for 4 nights is that the bins in your room aren’t emptied, you get no clean cups or tea/coffee top ups or changes of towel unless you ask. You have to change the bins yourselves and collect the cups and tea from the cleaning staff. I feel this should be reflected in the price. Other than that I will be back.

Very good breakfast - in fact better than I've had from a hotel for a long time.   I find a Premier Inn ok for a night  when I'm just staying because I am away but don't find them that relaxing.  Something to do with the design (bit too office like) and business model I think - not how the staff deliver what they're tasked with delivering which they did very well.   Bed was ok (we prefer a wider bed) and bathroom facilities worked really well.  Not sure I like the soap and tissue dispensers, remind me of office toilets rather than a comfortable hotel.

The windows and doors in the hotel were well insulted and you never hear the trains.  The hotel has a Thyme restaurant, which is one of my favorites at the Premier Inn.

Once in the shower I found that there was no shower gel/shampoo in the dispenser, it was completely empty.Again, no way of contacting reception other than to go there.  As I say, minor things but you expect soap and a towel for the price. Breakfast…",Date of stay: December 2017,2.0
