Parking was difficult to find and when we did check in I was shocked at the standard of our room especially considering that it had only been open a week follow the lifting of Covid restrictions.   The carpets were filthy as we walked down the corridor and when we entered our room there was a huge stain on the floor.  Ok I thought thats not the end of the world and after a 3 hour drive from the North West we were keen to get some rest for our busy weekend and this is where things got worse.  We pulled back the sheets on my sons bed to find them covered in what looked like sticky chewing gum. When my husband reported this to reception the girl could barley lift her head out of her phone to acknowledge his presence and there was no apology. This is in stark contrast to the lady we met when we checked in who was lovely and could not have been more friendly and engaging (Im sorry I didnt get her name).  On the plus side the location is perfect for travelling into London if you dont want to stay in the city as it is right over the train station and the journey takes about 20 mins on the tube.  You are right on the doorstep on Wembley stadium so again perfect if attending a football match or gig.  It also did feel safe once inside.  I would not be staying here again of we were to visit London again and unfortunately I would say to others to think twice about booking this hotel…,Date of stay: May 2021,2.0

It’s about a 15 min walk to the stadium from here.  The downside for us was on arrival the room wasn’t as clean as I would’ve expected! Yes, beds, bathroom and carpets were fine but the kettle had food stains on from previous occupants and the chairs also had stains on so evidently hadn’t been wiped over! I bought antibacterial wipes and cleaned all surfaces myself! Being in the middle of a pandemic I would’ve expected more!  You are on a main road, so ensure you take earplugs for a good nights sleep, sirens go past every few minutes!  Also the rooms are extremely hot, although there is a fan in the room to use.  As you walk down the corridors there are huge stains on the carpets and it’s looking quite grubby in areas. The staff on reception were really friendly and helpful! And Tesco is literally opposite the entrance.  All in all good location, however cleaning measures need looking at!…",Date of stay: May 2021,3.0

But it was £12 per 24 hrs, not £8 as advertised on TL's website. Another positive was the price for a Sat-to-Sun stay.  Our room was quiet, the bed was clean and bathroom was clean. Another positive was access to London central was good with Tube and Overground connections. Know that this hotel is zone 4, so max cap is around £10 per day.  Negatives were that our room was given away and we had to bump another person in order to stay. They were going to give us a cab ride to another TL nearby. That was frustrating at 11:30pm. Our room only had 1 bath towel, so that was a trip to reception. And finally, the room temp was warm on a 15C night. We had the fan full blast in the window but it was kind of uncomfortable.

The room was immaculate with a very comfy king size bed and the handy night light around the top of the bed which is a great idea. However the room was oppressively hot and even though they warn you with a newsletter and supply you with a fan nothing much can be done to alleviate this.  If you open the window, too much noise from outside, so I had the fan on most of the night but made little difference.

Wembley stadium and brilliant designer outlet again with loads of restaurants 10 min walk. Hotel clean and fantastic amenities.  Not many travel lodges these days have bars or a restaurant but this did and all well priced especially for London.  All you can eat breakfast was good value for money if u have kids as they ate free and 7.95 per adult. If u don't have kids I think over priced and would walk to weatherspoons two mins down the road.

We booked the travelodge in Wembley High Road initially as it was close to local transport which would have allowed us to get into London easily. We were also pleased to see that whilst not having its own car park, guests could park at a reduced rate on the local shopping centre car park. Due to roadworks and diversions, we arrived in London too late to go to the hotel before going into the city. We therefore arrived at the hotel well after midnight and struggled for over half an hour to find the car park which was not well signed. When we eventually arrived and checked into our room, we discovered the room only made up for three people instead of four.
