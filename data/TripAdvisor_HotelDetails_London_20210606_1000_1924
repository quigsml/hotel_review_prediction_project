At this moment the call was disconnected and when I tried calling back, the line just continuously busy. I managed with help of neighbors to reach their office, and when stepped in for check in the two staff panically said to me sorry we are not able to check you in because we have power failure in the building. Then he said we already informed booking,com to help find alternative accommodation. Ultimately I realized that my apartment was overbooked and they didn’t want to face me with this reality and then I had to find alternative option on the same day we arrive at London at one of the highest busy seasons (August) in London.

The fact there is no blinds in the kitchen and hall areas and therefore no privacy from the other flats, there is damp patches and paintwork cracking peeling off the walls, the broken toilet seat (which I did report on our arrival but nothing was done), the bedroom mirror is cracked at the bottom and very sharp, the plug socket in the hall area is loose from the wall, the bathroom tiles/grout are black and just look dirty (a bottle of bleach could easily solve this issue), the street outside was filthy, under one sofa in the living room was a chip/frie, under the bed is disgusting, nearly an inch full of dust with several cigarette ends under it, the plug to the iron is broken and dangerous and the sofa bed has a very sharp snapped piece of wood broken at the back. One of the windows in the bedroom doesn't even open and the area looking out from the hallway/kitchen (I'm guessing a fire escape) is disgusting, full of again cigarette ends and dirt. The most disappointing of all was the cleanliness of the place, we found so many long black hairs all over the flat, even on my daughters towel and I ended up hoovering on the 2nd morning it got that bad.  There was also a packet of cigarettes and a lighter left in the wardrobe, my children were sleeping in that bedroom and luckily didn't get hold of them. My husband and daughter have both been bitten several times, I can't say it's from the flat but given the cleanliness it seems likely. Quite frankly all this ruined our whole experience and i would not reccomend this place to anyone. It was overhaul just filthy and unhygienic!! We contacted the company when we were leaving to be told if we had complained they would have sent housekeeping in, but I complained about the broken toilet seat within an hour of arrival and nothing was done. Also housekeeping had supposedly been in before arrived.  We couldn't have the windows open (the ones that did open) due to a very noisy air con machine outside and the fact we were directly above 2 pubs where people were outside smoking till 11pm every night, it was incredibly noisy not to mention the smell of smoke from the people on the streets.

When we approached the entrance of the apartment walking through very dirty corridors our first negative impression was deepened as the carpets inside the apartment were also very dirty. The seat cushions were soiled with yellow paint residues and the table plate was littered by bubbles.  Opening the closed curtains we saw a scaffolding mounted over the whole balcony. Useless to mention that it was impossible to enter the balcony.  In one of the bedrooms the balcony door was locked with a padlock and could not be closed firmly. It was very cold during the night in this room and we were unable to heat sufficient.

Neither was it able to turn off or dim the light of the corridor nor to darken the window or close curtains of the living room window.

Ignored all communication via app, text, call and what’s app.   Rejected my calls but text my partners calls until they realised it was the same booking. Booked for 4 people, only given two towels. Checked the airing cupboard as the doors didn’t shut on the little landing. There was oodles of bath mats but no hand towels, kitchen towels or bath towels. (Good job you can buy towels from Sainsburys!!) 3 spoons, 1 bowl, 2 pasta bowls, 3 mugs provided. Large cracked bowl. Two cooking utensils. Open goods left in kitchen cupboard and freezer from ???? Oh the microwave stank, peeling rust on the inside door rim. Couldn’t open kitchen window as locked shut and no key inside but fear not the remote for changing mood lights in kitchen was left behind. Again so covid safe. Blind broken in the first floor bedroom. I presume once upon a time it was a living room judging by the 4 tables (tv stand but no tv). If you get the midnight munchies take a look under the bed as my son got to dine on popcorn And if you fancy a bump on the head stay in the back room with the balanced wardrobe in the alcove not attached to the wall (you left the fixing plates in the first floor bedside tables. P.S thanks for the plentiful freebies behind the headboards. Bathrooms: so in the ensuite the shower doors don’t fit the gap so there’s a baton either side of the doors with exposed screws, mouldy, dirty, gaping silicone, blocked drain to sink snd shower. Half used toiletries and loo roll left behind. So covid safe! The other shower was equally if not more dirty. All the extractors were filthy. Good job I take antibacterial wipes everywhere!! I can only assume the most recent reviews were either paid for false reviews or friends. This level of grim and dirt is a build up of a lot time, many weeks! It’s not just covid unsafe but even precovid unsafe. The kitchen had a small table, with two chairs (one of which is broken) Dirty sponges were left behind and the mop and bucket were left on the steep wonky stairs. Not suitable for mobility issues or buggy users. Two tv’s to the property, neither work ‍♀️‍♀️‍♀️ The one small fan at the property is broken with exposed mechanism/wires at the back, excellent when you have children. This could be a great apartment if they cleaned and stocked it properly and spent maybe even as little as £100 on kitchen items. If they’re that skint then look on the freepages. Even not matching is better than sharing 3 spoons between 4 people! We covid tested before arrival and will be testing tonight when we get home.

We contacted Trip.com, where we booked the hotel, who did their best to get us a refund but they also refused to refund to Trip.com. We contacted customer services and every single operator put us on hold or transferred us from department to department untill they said there was nothing they could do. Eventually we contacted the hotel direct who told us THEY WERE CLOSED FOR COVID LOCKDOWN!! So they were not able to even offer us the hotel stay but were still refusing to refund us. Luckily Trip.com were able to offer us an enforced refund after I they confirmed it would be closed over our booked dates when they contact the hotel as well.   A shambles of a hotel run by a corrupt customer services. AVOID AVOID AVOID Not worth the risk should anything go wrong before or during your stay.

I would never stay here again, given the opportunity, but to each his own, it might be a good option for someone else. Read on.   👍🏾The location was perfect! The building is within walking distance (12-15 mins.) to the Liverpool Transit/Underground Station.   👍🏾Traveling in either direction, Brick Lane is a fun street.   👍🏾The WiFi was great!   👍🏾👎🏾The space is cute, cozy, but w/ IKEA furnishings & decor, I expected much more. I was overwhelmingly disappointed.  -👎🏾Oversized blinds covered the windows and a leaky spot in the kitchen ceiling.   👎🏾We had to ask several times for enough towels and blankets, though we were told linens would be provided. I inquired and confirmed before we booked the flat. It is a studio fit for one person, maybe two at a maximum.   👍🏾We were allowed to check-in early and the self-entry was convenient. The owner provided easy instructions to enter codes/access a lock box.  -👎🏾However, anytime we were in and out of the flat, the main entrance (door) remained slightly ajar w/ a man smoking cigarettes just outside, soliciting customers for the adjacent restaurants. -👎🏾The door to our flat was missing a door knob, instead there was a hole to stick your finger through to make the door operable. It wasn’t exactly the secure feeling we were seeking in our home away from home. We managed however, as we were only in the flat to use the facilities and sleep.   👎🏾👎🏾Beware, the listing neglects to inform you the flat is a fourth-floor walk-up (narrow spiral staircase). See the attached image. Leave your heavy luggage at home because there is no elevator. If you are handicapped, the location is not accessible for you.   👎🏾The patio/deck looked like a trash collection station, it was not usable while we were there. If it’s cleaned up, the space would be nice to sit out on on a sunny day. See photos attached.   👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾And, the bathroom, what a disgusting mishap of a mess🥺 See the photos attached.  -👎🏾I seriously worried about its structural integrity. One wall was detaching when I took a towel off of a towel rack. The wall w/ the towel warmer was unstable as well.   -👎🏾Water was not draining properly in the shower. So, we showered with water pooling at our feet. There was hot water, thank God. There was a perpetual leak under the sink and around the toilet. We informed the owner and a plumber arrived to look at the problems. He basically explained to me the plumbing system was outdated and left. He didn’t fix the problem so, we had to deal w/ it until we left.   - 👎🏾We could not flush toilet paper in the toilet🥺I have no further words about this.   - 👎🏾There was also a perpetual stench, stink, a wet and musty odor in the bathroom, we had to leave the window open to allow ventilation. Perhaps there is mold. It was unbearable. The thunderous sound whenever the faucet was turned on or the toilet was flushed was quite a nuisance. I wonder how the neighbors feel.   👎🏾We were asked not to use the heat unless absolutely necessary. It was December in London 🙄and it was cold, so, we used the heat. We thought it was silly to be asked not to use the heating.   👎🏾The television barely had any working channels.   👎🏾👎🏾Overall, I am upset we spent $1,200+ to stay at this flat. I could have splurged a bit more and actually enjoyed downtime in our flat after exploring London all day long. …",[''],"['100Great for walkersGrade: 100 out of 100', '383Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '71Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']",,"#684 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",1,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","{'All languages': 1, 'English': 1}","['£90 - £192 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'United KingdomEnglandLondonSpitalfields']"

Check-in was odd: they wanted ID of some sort (passport or driving licence, neither of which I carried) and wouldn't simply take my emailed confirmation as evidence I'd booked it (which I hadn't - it was done by my office).  However, once I'd proven that it was me that paid for it, I was granted keys.  I also tried to modify my booking to include another guest but for some reason they couldn't do it at the desk - I had to contact booking.com myself and instruct them so that they could instruct the hotel, which made a mockery of the website mentioning contacting them for amendments if they appear powerless to do so - it just felt like they weren't interested in any work unless booking.com directed them to do it.  I thought I'd simply get a room but I ended up with an apartment on the first floor, which was pretty spacious - in addition to the bedroom and large bathroom there's a kitchen featuring lounge and TV; the booking felt more suited to families for a stay away.  The bedroom's general décor is akin to a sparse student room.  Although touted as a double, it felt more like a single room with a double bed, with a bedside cabinet and lamp on just one side (which obscured a wall socket containing USB ports) and nothing on the other, furnished with an electric heater hidden behind the curtain (meaning the heat was possibly blocked by the curtain and directed out of the window - why not on wall elsewhere?) but despite its size it was very warm and welcoming for a chilly November night.  The windows cut out a fair amount of sound so there's little disturbance at night, especially during minor noise from the Nov5th celebrations.  There's no TV in the bedroom - this is to be found out in the lounge which features a kitchenette to the side, dining table, sofa, chair etc - I didn't make much use of it but appreciated the facilities.  The bathroom was large - the bath was equipped with a shower and the toilet featured a sanitisation seal across it.  Given the grout between the tiles were somewhat grotty (and some tiles were cracked and loose) this felt like a token gesture.  The heated towel rail is powered by a switch out in the corridor - given it's unlabelled, it's not obvious.  Other signs of poor quality control included some decrepit fittings (like sockets hanging off walls) and a non-working clock... is it so hard to get these things right?  Nonetheless, it was good enough that when I was to return a week later, I booked the same place. This time I was given a room at the end of the corridor which was a far cry from my previous visit: although we had two bedside cabinets only one lamp was provided (and was unplugged), no other bedside power points, a non-functioning clock on the wall (is this mandatory in all rooms?) and the bathroom was pretty chilly with a poorly-repaired window and grubby walls - the bedroom was much warmer, so the bathroom lacked any thermal insulation at all.  Wifi here was also haphazard - there were two routers in the room itself with overlapping signals (one had an SSID of ""test"").. everything felt like it was a rush job and the room itself was rarely-used.  Although I slept okay the nights I was there, that last experience has put me off from returning there in case I get assigned that same room again.…","['', 'English, Spanish, Italian, Romanian and 1 more']","['100Great for walkersGrade: 100 out of 100', '499Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '71Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']","Free High Speed Internet (WiFi), Internet, Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly), Baggage storage, Non-smoking hotel, Clothes rack, Iron, Flatscreen TV, Complimentary toiletries, Hair dryer, Non-smoking rooms","#687 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",95,"[16, 21, 21, 10, 27]","{'All languages': 95, 'English': 46, 'Italian': 22, 'Spanish': 11}","['£140 - £166 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'United KingdomEnglandLondonWhitechapel']"

On arrival I couldn't enter the building and rang the company only to be told I had to wait until 4 until we could enter. The lady on the phone was unapologectic and seemed rude. She justified the mix up by saying they were a big company and couldn't chase everything up.   After 2 1/2 hours waiting with 2 small children we were then beyond disappointment with the apartment. It is tiny compared to the one we had booked and a completely different lay out and look.   Slightly grubby, marks on the walls and floors, no toilet paper in the bathroom, bin in the kitchen and towel rail have marks all over them, toaster and kettle are grubby, sofa bed set up in the front room but no curtains to block out the light. The apartment is on a main road with a street light directly outside, there is only a net curtain which does nothing to block out the light. Very little attention to detail.   We rang them again only to be faced with even worse customer service and rudeness and told that the picture they use while you're booking the apartment is not necessarily the one you'll be given (even though this was not stated at all!).

The service was very unprofessional and the place is not as advertised on Instagram and whatever other social media you might see so don't even be fooled when booking here by these nice photos you're seeing. Firstly, the place was absolutely filthy and I did not even have time to take photos of everything, but the room was filled with stains on the blinds, sofa, tables next to the bed. In the photos below that I had taken you can see (didn't have time to take photos of everything), there was dead flies and insects on the walls and in multiple places which hadn't even been cleaned and stains on the sofa. It really does not feel like a sanitary place to stay in. At least have the decency to clean the room properly. There wasn't even toilet roll in the toilet!! Secondly, it's funny that this was posted in another review on Booking.com where the person mentioned that they changed their room last minute ""because of the police"" which is the EXACT same thing that happened to me, I had to find out when I have arrived that my room has ""suddenly been changed"". They didn't communicate with me at all and for that reason I would never recommend this kind of unreliable service to anyone. The service from start to finish was shambles, I had to chase for everything that I booked for, any help I needed and there was no proper assistance or service given. The door of the room wouldn't even lock properly!! I had to leave early due to not even feeling comfortable with the state of the room and the events that happened and there was no real remorse for anything that happened other than ""sorry about that"" through a text message! No real apology or explanation or compensation. The original room did look nice but the point is the difference between the rooms was completely unacceptable - I paid and expected to be in a nicer room based on what I was shown and you gave me the complete opposite in every aspect. It's not even about compensation but I trusted to pay my own money and was not given a good experience whatsoever, and he still did not seem to care.

But it’s boiling hot. I was there for a week so bought provisions for the fridge, however the small freezer compartment door  inside the fridge freezer is missing, which means the freezer is trying to freeze the entire contents of your fridge. Woke up to everything frozen. Frozen salad, frozen boiled eggs, frozen chicken. Wasted all my money. There is an Induction Hob (basically it’s a hob plate glued to the sink draining board) doesn’t come with an induction saucepan so you have to use the communal kitchen anyway, where surprise surprise the fridge door doesn’t shut there either. The bed..oh the bed if that’s what they call it. It’s on the floor, it’s a low level futon with the cheapest oldest mattress I have ever slept on. It was so thin (as were the pillows) you could feel every spring. Didn’t sleep at all.

In realtà un mese prima del nostro soggiorno abbiamo ricevuto mail dalla struttura che ci comunicava che cambiava alloggio assicurandoci che fosse migliore di quello scelto da noi. Veniamo al dunque, l’appartamento era in pessimo stato con un servizio fatiscente sporco e con difetto di perdita nel rubinetto. Poi il water era situato in una stanzetta neanche di 1 metro quadro e poco accessibile e scomodissimo oltre che molto sporco. L’aeratore non funzionava e nemmeno la luce si accendeva!!!Le stanze da letto erano sporchissime in condizioni igieniche oltre il limite, dentro un armadio abbiamo trovato persino un sacco grande contenente delle lenzuola sporche utilizzate da altri che hanno soggiornato prima di noi!!! La cucina in condizioni pessime, incrostato il piano cottura e tutto macchiato...le prese erano talmente luride e incrostate che avevano impregnate la forma della spina!!! Abbiamo dovuto sgrassare tutto il piano cottura e il tavolo su cui mangiare. Abbiamo contattato il gestore dell’appartamento e pure Booking.com in quanto motore di ricerca utilizzato per scegliere il soggiorno in questo appartamento, ebbene dopo 4 ore dicasi 4 e dopo invio di varie foto il centro assistenza di Booking.com ci ha informati che il gestore avrebbe solo provveduto l’indomani a mandarci qualcuno per le pulizie. Come minimo ci aspettavamo un cambio di appartamento o rimborso!!!Noi siamo andati a dormire in condizioni assurde e poi il giorno dopo siamo andati fuori presto per una gita prenotata. Al ritorno abbiamo constatato solo che mancava il sacco con le lenzuola sporche dentro armadio. Tutto il resto era stato tralasciato e non pulito. A quel punto abbiamo deciso di andarcene da quel tugurio prenotando un altro appartamento che ci ha pienamente soddisfatto. Sicuramente chiederemo rimborso a Booking.com e al gestore ma siamo sicuri che non avverrà...una vergogna!!! Assolutamente da evitare a tutti i costi Stylish Apartment in Victoria!!!!

However upon arriving at 1.30pm at the separate location to collect the keys, we were rudely told that the key wasnt there for our room, as check in wasn't until 2pm. When we informed him that we had received a message that day to say the key was available from 1pm he made us show him the message,and then made an angry phone call to someone else. We were given a key for ""the same room in a different building"", but it was as if he was doing us a favour!! The room itself was very basic but to be fair I cannot complain about the cleanliness and the bed was comfy enough. We knew that it was a shared bathroom, and while this was also very basic and in need of some TLC, it was as expected and again it was quite clean (although no hand towel or drying facilities provided).   With your key you are given a fob to get you in the front door....however on arriving back to the building on the first night our fob to get in the front door wouldn't work!!! And a low battery signal kept flashing on the fob terminal on the door! We tried ringing the numbers provided in the booking email but no answer. It was close to midnight and not an area where you want to be left out on the street!! Luckily a window in the first floor was open and we were able to shout up and ask them to let us in, I'm not too sure what we would have done otherwise?! Two mornings later we checked the fob on our way out and terminal was completely out of battery again and couldn't be used to open the door, very worrying, we sent a message to the host who replied telling us that it had been fixed and luckily it was working when we got home that evening.  We were also woken very early each morning by the people in the room above us, if you're staying in the room under the stairs like we were the noise of anyone going up and down the stairs will wake you!

I was there to work, so I woke early and only really was present in my room to sleep. Still, usually, you can get a single room for a similar price in a hostel, I will be doing that if need be next time around. I would not return here.   The location is good, although the entrance to the hotel is just a door and hard to find. (It's to the left side of the blue store, in the little alleyway). There is an Asda right across the street, a co-op and Tesco express are also really close (although Tesco runs out of meal deals incredibly quickly, be there between 9 and 9.10 in the morning or they're all gone). It is just a few minutes away from Stepney Green Underground station, and ten minutes away from Whitechapel. As I was working at an office a few stops away, this was incredibly convenient.  There are also plenty of places to eat around there, and if you take out it is easy to stay under 5 pounds. This is convenient as the kitchen facilities at the hotel are no longer in true working order. No plates or bowls available, and the clothes washer and dryer are taped shut.   Now for all which I wasn’t exactly pleased with… The building is old, which of course cannot be helped, but due to this, and due to someone having smoked in there, the smell of smoke seems to have seeped into the walls. Whenever I turned the heating on, the smell would make an appearance, which was a real shame. The walls and the ceiling also showed signs of wear, they could do with a touch-up. It was also concerning to me that the fire alarm seems to have been removed. Presumably, because the smoke smell keeps setting it off, but it feels unsafe.   Also, they could have been better at cleaning. I stayed at my room for 11 nights and upon arrival, it wasn't what I call incredibly clean. Everything was dusty, the remote was sticky, and the bedding was dirty. When I mentioned the bedding, it was immediately replaced, so plus-points for that... But in regards to the rest of the room, it did not get cleaned once during my stay. While this did help me feel like my stuff was safe during the day as nobody was entering my room, 11 days is quite long to go without a proper hoover. I've kept the room clean myself with makeup wipes.   In regards to the complaints about not having fresh towels, I got one every other day, but this did mean bringing your dirty one to reception to get it swapped. As the staff is not present for the whole day, I can imagine that missing them would be easy. Also, the staff is iffy. Some are quite nice, others are incredibly rude, customer service doesn’t seem to be a word in their dictionary. One even got cross with me because I did not have electricity for the TV and heater (a fuse blew) as if that somehow was my fault?   In regards to the bathroom facilities, when originally booking I was convinced that I would have an ensuite. It was not made clear to me that all facilities would be shared. Thankfully, I don't mind this, so this wasn't a huge problem. These were cleaned twice a day so never found toilets or showers incredibly dirty. I also managed to get the water scalding hot for showers but that means fiddling around with the settings a bit. Appears that this is only possible on the second door of the showers, so be sure to pick that one! Just don't look up during the showers, as the entire ceilings are overgrown with mould.  To be honest, this place could be something, but currently it is not receiving the love and attention it needs and the staff don’t seem too clued up on customer service. Bit sad.…",[],"['89Good for walkersGrade: 89 out of 100', '55Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '7Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']",,"#1,018 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",9,"[0, 1, 1, 3, 4]","{'All languages': 9, 'English': 5, 'French': 2, 'German': 1, 'Italian': 1}","['£28 - £65 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'United KingdomEnglandLondon']"

All in all a terrible experience; never got any resolution even after writing multiple emails with the word “urgent” on the subject, even after living in various messages on their mailbox and wasting a lot of money on some phone calls from another country to them, when finally got replies none of them addressed any of the problems I was having and on top of it, not even an apology was ever given, even after finally explaining word by word and on detail what the experience had been like.

One week before our stay they asked me to update my debit card because it had been rejected by the hotel. That was weird, since my card was working perfectly fine also for other bookings in Booking.com . I then introduced the data of my other (visa) card. which was again rejected and, to my surprise, my reservation was intermediately cancelled by the company. When I tried to communicate with them through email or through booking, they stopped answering through both channels.  I called to the phone number provided in their website and they basically told me the same. My cards were rejected by them (even though I have the proof that at least one of them worked, since they successfully charged me 1 pound), therefore our booking was cancelled and there was no other option to reactivate it. The lady on the phone was insisting that I should hang out and I will receive an email with an explanation in 30 min, which obviously I never did. I called again, and again the same lack of explanation, and insistence on me to wait for an email. I am still waiting for that email.. That left us with no accommodation in London less than one week before our arrival. After this, I searched and found a review telling a similar experience. I don't know the reason why they did this. Maybe they overbooked and they did not wanted to admit it or maybe they look for profit with these kind of practices... But the experience was dreadful, and the customer service absolutely terrible.

Very short walk to the tube station and numerous shops, restaurants, medical services, pharmacies, dry cleaners, grocery and other conveniences.   We paid around 120/night for the second floor. I won't argue if it was a great value or not, but as the other reviews mentioned, the room is in need of better upkeep. The furniture was somewhat lacking and looked like an incomplete Ikea room set. The bathroom was inefficient in spacing and I hurt my head while trying to utilize the narrow facilities. The road noise was unavoidable. Internet was spotty, but the owner was confident it would work just fine. One of the windows would not lock, so we made sure to use the lockbox. Some of the lamps did not have lightbulbs.   There is a washer/dryer on site, which helps a lot.

The B&B is in a hip (art college), but a bit gritty area (an issue or not, depending on what you're used to or expecting). We liked that it was in a residential area - it was very quiet at night and it provided a ""slice of London life"" away from the tourist attractions.   We walked quite a bit in the area and never encountered any problems, picked up provisions from the local corner store, and found a decent selection of reasonably priced local restaurants and coffee shops. At the St. Giles church down around the corner on Camberwell Church St, we attended funky Friday night jazz for £8 each.There was a bus stop close by, but we walked instead a half hour to the Elephant & Castle tube station - the distance to the tube being the one disadvantage to an otherwise accommodating neighbourhood.  The B&B itself was clean and comfortable, with two full separate bathrooms on the second floor (no en suite). We had a double room adequate to our needs, with good paid wifi and a (free) TV we never used. Our breakfasts were generous in quantity with decent selection (breakfasts were included in our basic rate, but double-check with Pedro, because there's some ambiguity on the website).  Pedro himself was a very gracious, kindly and helpful host, responding promptly when we requested lighter bedding, for instance, and buying real cream for my coffee when I asked for it. He was able to advise us on an accessible tube station so that we didn't have to lug our luggage up & down stairs en route to Heathrow airport, and went out of his way to make all the arrangements for a hired car to get us there - much appreciated!

They emailed us the code which is located on the outside of the door you need to remember to access building and there is a lock box inside the lobby to retrieve keys. The beds need to be upgraded you can feel the springs. They do have a safe however I took out the batteries as couldn’t access with code and used Key. Didn’t like the safe it was mounted on floor and my mom couldn’t get to it should be mounted in a dresser or something. They have a door going from hall way to living area which we used for privacy while getting ready as other windows can see inside building or blinds left open. The washer dryer came in handy.

Also I noticed they came in and cleaned my apartment which I didn’t ask for and reading the book on the table they charge $60 each time so be sure to let them know do not clean. Oh the doors facing the street do not use the key to lock cause we did and the key got stuck we called and they came right out showing us how to shut and lock those doors you just close and pull door handle up couple times.

I have been in hospitality most of my working life. I worked in wine bars and chalets during the 70s, I became a private chef for a number of celebrities and Merchant Banks during the 80s. I first opened up my home to guests coming to London to study English in the early 90s. It is at this time that I started B&B full time, since then I have hosted thousands of people from around the world. On average I have over 900 people a year walk through my front door. I like people, I like hosting, I like hospitality - it is what I enjoying doing and it is something that I m good at. We are not the cheapest nor the most expensive, nor are we right in the centre of the city. But what we do offer is a warm and welcoming environment for guests to enjoy and relax during their stay. All of the rooms have been individually styled and furnished, with kingsize beds, flat screen TVs as well as their own bathroom, two are EnSuite and one is a Private bathroom. We have complinmentary WiFi throughout the whole house as well as an extensive DVD collection that all guests are welcome to browse. When it comes to breakfast we always provide a Home-Style continental as well as a cooked option that can be anything from: Scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, French Toast with hot blueberries and/or maple syrup or sausage, bacon and eggs. We always serve yogurt, fresh fruit salad or a bowl of fruit, as well as a vegetarian option. We are very flexible when it comes to fitting in we our guests needs, for instance if you wish to swap breakfast for dinner one night during your stay, we are very happy to accommodate. If our guests have an early start we always provide them with a breakfast to go: a slice of pie or cake, a sandwich, fruit and a drink. There is always a homemade cake or dessert on the side for all our guests to enjoy when they arrive back in the evenings after a long day of travelling, working or sightseeing. If you are like me, and sometimes a coffee or tea in the evening doesn't quite cut it then our guests can have a glass of wine or beer or if your feeling a little adventurous then why not sample one of the many Gins, Vodkas and Whiskeys that we have on our shelf. Having been a professional host for many years, I am always putting my own stamp on things - for instance we make our own Marmalade and Jams, as well as Limoncello. We believe in efficiency and not wasting food, we source our produce as locally as possible: our breads come from a mix of speciality and commercial bakeries, our milk is delivered three times a week from a farm in Kent and our bacon and sausages comes from the local butcher. I love London, it is for me the most exciting city in the world. There is always something happening 24/7 365 days a year! We provide our guests with up to date information about what to do locally, with our own in house booklet. We also write a bi-monthly update all about London - so that our guests can hit the ground running and find that something a little bit different that they may not have known or thought about, when planning their travels.

L' appartamento molto pulito e ben tenuto con ambienti soddisfacenti per il nr. di persone che ospita, potrebbe ulteriormente affinare le sue caratteristiche. Infatti se il numero max di ospiti è otto persone, sarebbe carino trovare un nr. di suppellettili e posate adeguato e anche il parco pentole andrebbe rivisto perché le padelle sono usurate e non si presentano benissimo. A disposizione ci sono tanti e vari utensili ma un tegame vero e proprio per la pasta non c'è nonostante ci sia lo scolapasta. Ripeto sono sottigliezze però anche con le migliori intenzioni tutti sti panini dopo due giorni non ne puoi più compreso il famoso pesce fritto e senti subito l'astinenza da pasta. Peccato che in cucina la finestra sia bloccata per cui non si possa  aprire. Interessante la lavatrice per chi fa lunghi soggiorni, poiché il corredo consiste in un  telo doccia e viso a testa. Ci sono ben due stendibiancheria e il posto per aprirli non manca per cui veramente ci si può ben organizzare. I bagni sono nuovi, grandi e ambedue ciechi però ben sistemati infatti la proprietà mette a disposizione anche i prodotti per l'igiene personale; peccato solo che il lavandino del bagno in camera sia di dimensioni veramente ridotte e anche solo lavare i denti risulti complicato; difficile capire la scelta dell'uso dello  spazio.

The flat has 2 decent sized bedrooms with double beds and a small living room with a sofa bed. We arrived quite late and were quite eager to get in and have a brew. Not enough mugs, the mugs that were there weren't clean so had to be cleaned before being shared by the 6 of us. On closer inspection there wasn't enough dinner plates, bowls well everything really plus it all had to be washed before being used. Time for bed to ready ourselves for the big rugby game the next day, one couple had to sleep on the floor. Sofa-bed was broken and wouldn't lie flat. Now to be fair to Amir, he ordered mugs which arrived by 8am the next morning. No extra plates though. Pity he couldn't have sorted the sofa bed, he reckoned he inspected it and the broken bits had no impact on the actual mechanism of the bed. I beg to differ matey. The kitchen is dated and the shower in the bathroom had to be propped up by a shampoo bottle as the fixing was broken. If you stay here, please take earplugs. The trains are literally behind the property and it's also under every flight path for the UK and nasa! Nowhere did it say in any description of this property that none of us would be getting any sleep all weekend due to planes trains and automobiles. The garden is overgrown and tatty, don't look out of the windows, apparently that's to do with the downstairs neighbour?! The whole road is grotty with rubbish and dirty nappies everywhere. Good points, it is really close to pubs, restaurants and Twickenham. Not far from airport or train stations either. For what we paid for the whole weekend, I expected clean dishes to eat and drink from and a sofa-bed that wasn't clinging on to life by a wing and a prayer. Amir needs to have a word with downstairs and try and encourage them to sort out the eyesore of a garden, employ a decent cleaner and make sure there is plenty of cloths and washing up liquid. Also replace the bloody sofa bed before somebody puts a claim in for loss of a limb or death by springs. …",[],"['56Somewhat walkableGrade: 56 out of 100', '111Restaurantswithin 0.75 miles', '6Attractionswithin 0.75 miles']",,"#590 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",1,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","{'All languages': 1, 'English': 1}","['£50 - £67 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'United KingdomEnglandLondon']"

We had just checked out of the B$B and were on our way to the subway to catch a trip to an area north of London to visit relatives.  We purchased our tickets and as we entered the subway, an attendant stopped us and closed the metal gates.  ""Probably an electrical problem"" was the explanation.  We waited a bit and decided to try a different gate.  No luck.  They were all locked down.  And the street buses pulled over, unloaded, and did not allow anyone on. We walked into a mini-mall to see if anyone knew what was happening.  Then all hell broke.  Within a few minutes we noticed police officers partially running through mall and then the sirens outside in the streets began.  Emergency vehicles, fire trucks.....and then cars marked ""Scotland Yard-Bomb Squad"" or something to that effect. Almost immediately every store in London locked their doors and people began to walk home.  Very few cars in the street as most Londoners use public transportation in the main part of London.  It was a very somber scene.  No laughing.  No camaraderie. Everyone was very serious. We walked to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  About 1/2 miles from there a street was cordoned off by Scotland Yard.  Far away we could see a bus the the entire top blown off by a bomb. At the museum, we were searched (unlike the day before).  And the museum attendants told us what had happened. We immediately called The White House Bed and Breakfast, explained our situation, and they offered one solution.  As they were totally booked, they said they would let us stay in their son's room.  It was a very tiny room on the top floor...and we were happy to get it.  That evening (and into the night) we watched the news on the horrible bomb attack by terrorists. I do remember their breakfasts.  A traditional English breakfast.  Great bacon and eggs...and Pork and Beans. Good coffee!

Master bedroom bed was broken. A slat was missing, causing the mattress to sink down one side. My wife therefore slept in the second bedroom,, which aggravated her back to be extremely painful. She had little sleep as a result.The maintenance man made an aborted attempt to fix the bed on I think the second day of our stay. Michael, our contact on arrival, also tried over the weekend. Despite three complaints, the bed was eventually repaired two weeks into our stay. 3. One of the poor quality dining chairs collapsed on me as the legs had been adjusted to splay out too far.. This did no more than cause me mild surprise - but it could have been more serious. We got a replacement at t he end of the second week. 4. There was no chopping board. A replacement was brought after a couple of days. 5. The master bedroom toilet seat was loose - again took days to get fixed. Standard lamp light bulb needed replacing. 7. The top drawer of the dishwashers broken on arrival. Maintenance made it partially usable but it was difficult to pull out for the rest of the three weeks - despite maintenance making a second visit with supposedly a spare part. 8. The white toilet brush holders were brown coloured around the rim and the brushes inside were in a disgusting state. 9. A previous occupants ravioli was left in a cupboard in a saucepan.  We were promised a deep clean but to our knowledge this never happened.  So it appears as though the pre let checks and cleaning were sadly lacking. The response by management to emails was unhelpful to say the least. We requested a cash refund but this was flatly refund, instead offering some voucher for a future stay. A stay we could not have considered with this company.  Following this 3 week stay in squalor, instead of rebooking with this company, we moved to another serviced apartment in this area, where things were done as they should have been at Lantern Court.  On the plus side, the flat was spacious but the fittings were cheap cheap cheap, sofas, chairs, TV, appliances, beds etc. The concierges were very helpful.  The staff on the telephone were always very pleasant but promised to come back to us but never did.  The wifi is poor. There is 1 GB available but we only ever got a couple of meg.

Девушка, которая меня заселяла, сказала, что есть же на букинге регистрация и ее мне должно быть достаточно. Это тоже минус!  Нет разъемов для розеток.

Но все же чистую посуду оказывается можно найти (хотя я это поняла не сразу, увы).  В соседях были девушка-азиатка. Я ее и не видела и не слышала. А вот в последнюю ночь заехали 2 парня из Франции или Испании, мало того что свиньи, еще и хлопали дверями, разбудили, больше я не уснула. Унитаз весь уделанный,- я одного ткнула носом и заставила вытереть. В комнате и ванной грибок от сырости.Постельное белье как после кого-то. Мне кажется, что ничего и не меняли , скорее всего.  Мыло кончилось и ничего не принесли. Пользовалась тем, что дали в другом отеле.  Вроде бы уютная квартира, но впечатление от заезда осталось очень неприятное. Приехала утром из другого отеля.

Хорошо, что мужчина - торговец, увидев мои страдания, помог и позвонил. Оказывается, ключи надо было брать в  восковом салоне рядом через дверь - 214.

Hotel in November. The apartment for 3 turned out to be a small double bedroom with a folding bed added in the only small space available. Hardly room to swing a cat. The blurb on the booking sheet grossly over egged the facilities available with some items being mentioned twice (TV, lift) and even 3 times (shower, toilet, bathroom, bath or shower, towels). Some items mentioned did not exist - dressing room, tea/coffee maker. The city view was of houses on the other side of the road . The toilet door could not be closed completely. Some of the facilities in the room did not function properly, eg the air conditioning, and we had two uncomfortable nights of sleep, because it was too warm.There were no instructions for the electrical gadgets eg microwave - not so easy to use. The room was noisy from the pub underneath.  The toilet flush collapsed, and we could not flush the toilet.  There was no one on reception to speak with except during the hours of 1000-1600, or we had phone numbers to make contact with during the hours of 0900-1800 , otherwise we would have to text. Very unsatisfactory.  We asked to be moved from this unsatisfactory (non executive ) room, and found on our return extra towels, soap, biscuits and instant coffee, with the toilet flush put back in, in the same room. We had paid £400.55 (non returnable and taken off my credit card in advance) for this non executive room. Of which £51 was for the cleaning fee after we had left ! I note that the price is £80 on the website now. We paid £119 per night - £39 for the provision of a cot bed! On the second day the toilet flush again collapsed, and we made significant representations to the receptionist to move us to a room where we had an 'executive apartment' comparable to the money we had paid . The receptionist was sympathetic to our request, and managed to get the manager (not present ) to agree to move us. On our return later that day, we had been moved to an 'executive ' apartment, but there were still some things one would expect to be provided for guests - tea towel, dish cloth and scouter, etc.  Could not rate the hotel below.

I arrived slightly earlier than the agreed check of 4pm to find the apartment with remnants of the previous occupant, so I then range guest services to notify them of my findings and was told that it hadn't yet been cleaned as it was earlier than the check in. I accepted that as the reason and was assured that this would be cleaned and then agreed to come back later.  I arrived back the apartment at around 9pm that evening, expecting everything to ready and cleaned only find that the room was in exactly the same state I saw it in before 4pm. I again rang the Guest services number and spoke to a gentleman that appologised and went away to check what he could do, when he returned to the phone is only options were to send me half way across London to another apartment or try and get someone to come and clean (half) clean the apartment, baring in mine that it was now approaching 9:30pm and he suggested they could be there in about 20mins it would have been well after 10am by the time someone would have started to clean the place.  By then I had decided to just go and look for somewhere else to stay, I was then told that he would get someone to call me first thing in the morning and arrange for a refund and discuss compensation for the inconvenience that had been caused.  I then had to call the Guest Services number again at 3;21pm on the 14th August, as I hadn't had a call and spoke to yet another person, who told me that he was made aware of what had happened and proceeded to tell me that they had made every attempt to help me, by which he means move me across London and or come and clean the apartment and if it was a bonus they will arrange the full refund, which will take up to 10 days to go back on to my card........I asked him if that was all they were prepared to do to which he replied we have arranged a refund!!

The process to pay the deposit so that my colleagues could actually stay in the property was long-winded and arduous, and it took several attempts to get hold of the owner, Darren. The price stated in the T&Cs for the deposit was different to what we had to pay after learning that each individual staying in the property would have to pay for bed linen and towels. As a corporate company, we requested an invoice so that we could offset the cost in our financial paperwork, however 3 months later we still have not received it.  My colleagues staying did admittedly forget to switch the boiler off and leave the parking permit in the property when they vacated it despite the fact that they did not need to use it over the duration of their stay – they also did not receive any parking tickets over the course of the week that they were staying here, rendering the need for the permit useless anyway. We were informed that the individuals who stayed in the property after we left received a parking ticket as they did not have the permit and that the cost of the ticket would be taken from our already overcharged deposit. Over the following 5 days, I attempted to call Darren 5 times to find out how much of the deposit we would lose to no avail as he never answered. We did manage to get in contact with a man called Tom who I assumed co-manages the property. He was extremely rude and unhelpful, refusing to give me details of the parking ticket, stating that we would not have any of our £270 deposit returned to cover the cost of the ticket. I hardly believe that a parking fine can equate to the sum of £270!  I have still not been able to get hold of either Darren or Tom, had no returned phone calls or emails and not received the invoice that we requested when we booked the property 3 months ago.

The rooms are self-contained apartments with comfortable, basic facilities. Every room has an ensuite bathroom, bed and access to a kitchen (regular rooms share a kitchen, suites have a kitchenette but the kitchen facilities - pots, utensils etc - are limited). The rooms do not have a television, hairdryer or kettle but there are social areas with TVs and lounge facilities. The Hashtag staff are available from the morning until early evening to help check-in/out and look after luggage (for an additional cost), after which the on-site security keep watch over the building.   When I visited, I stayed in one of the suite rooms which contained a double bed, desk, wardrobe, kitchenette and bathroom. The kitchen consisted of a sink, fridge, freezer, microwave, hob and cupboards, with two sets of plates, bowls, side plates, cups, glasses and cutlery. There is a small pan but no cooking implements. You're left two sets of towels, shampoo and shower gel. This is not a hotel room and as such does not get cleaned and replenished daily, but I believe it does after a certain number of days for an extended stay.  I stayed with Hashtag Shepherd's Bush for a couple of days in August, shortly after they had set up. The staff seemed to still be getting to grips with running it, but it was mostly a smooth experience. I arrived before check-in was open and paid £5 for my bags to be stored, and when I returned later on there was some confusion between the staff when retrieving them. This was only a minor issue, and before long I was checked in, issued a room key and given access to the wifi. The key fob gives key-less access after hours to the building and opens the doors to the landing and room. The main area just past check-in consists of several lounge spaces and a games area with a pool table and vending machines, which are all available to guests.  The room itself was perfect for my short stay, with every basic facility and some extras to make it a convenient visit. My biggest problem in terms of facilities was the lack of kettle, which would have been a nice addition. The room was large, clean and had ample storage areas. Unfortunately, as it was the height of summer, it was also swelteringly hot! The window only opens a little way and as this was one of the hottest weekends of the year, it was hotter inside the room than outside.   Aside from the heat, I couldn't really fault Hashtag Shepherd's Bush. The staff may have been getting to grips with the system, but they were all very friendly, helpful and resolved any issues that came about. The rooms and facilities were excellent for the price, and (aside from the temperature) everything was very comfortable and pleasant. You would struggle to stay in London at even the most dingy facility for £60 a night (believe me; I've stayed in my share of horrible hotels!) so this was a very reasonably priced and comfortable alternative.

It is, however, a most reasonable one if you're on a tight budget and want a single room.  Cons: - the size of the toilet. Laugh all you want, but believe me, I've never seen so small a toilet! I kept hitting my elbows and felt claustrophobic. - could be cleaner, but then the £24 rate doesn't come from nowhere, does it. - the view from my room was... uninviting, to put it mildly. Some brick wall and wires. - one day the towels disappeared from my room. I'm not complaining that much, because I had my own, but still. - the showers were basic, there wasn't even a place to put soap. - there was just one double wall socket in the room, the bed lamp plugged to one of them. Plus, it was located behind the bed, so whenever I wanted to plug something, I had to move the bed, which was most inconvenient.  Pros: - I do believe it's one of the cheapest single room available in London. Which means something. - It was reasonably clean, especially the room. - There is a self-catering kitchen. - Contrary to what I feared, the location is pretty great. The Residence is just a few bus stops from Barbican Station, which provides a percect access to Central London. To the North, a little further from the Residence, is the Angel station with loads of shops (Sainsbury's, M&S, Waitrose) and a shopping mall. There are lots of cafes nearby, and the bus connections are great - it didn't even take me 20 minutes to come back from the National Theatre or The Globe in the evening by bus.   Summing up, I will probably keep looking for my favourite London stopover, but I'll definitely remember about Finsbury Residence and will probably come back. After all, cheap, well-located and clean single rooms don't grow on trees in London.…",[],"['100Great for walkersGrade: 100 out of 100', '146Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '28Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']",Laundry service,#324 of 863 B&Bs / Inns in London,2,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]","{'All languages': 2, 'English': 1, 'Italian': 1}","['United KingdomEnglandLondonIslington', '10']"

Det finns 4 (eller 5) rum totalt och de har olika standard.   MINDRE BRA: Ingen hotellskylt på framdörren, endast nummer 9. Ingen reception, man ska anmäla ankomsttid i förväg då blir man väntat eller hittar man en nyckel under framdörren.   Nyckelhål på framdörren är på knähöjd.

Dessutom fanns i rummet vattenkokare, koppar och kaffe/te/socker, samt en stol och en fläkt. Det fanns inget klädskåp eller hyllor för att placera kväder, kanske, berodde det på att det fanns ingen plats för dessa.  Det gick bra att stänga dörren men inte att låsa eftersom låset saknades helt (!). Efter dörren var stängd tog luften slut på 5 min eftersom luftkonditionering saknades och vi kunde inte öppna fönster, det var låst.

We didn't have any drawers and had to live out of our suitcase for the duration of our stay. One mattress had a large piece missing out of it; we had three single bed duvets for two double beds, three pillows and three towels between four adults! The whole building was tired looking and could have done with a lick of paint.  To be fair, when we complained, the mattress was replaced and more towels were delivered but the lady who organised this was quite shirty about it!

I stumbled across 'The old bakery' and although the price seemed almost too good to be true, it was only a 15-minute walk from where I was working.  Communications from the staff were excellent.  I emailed them informing them of my arrival time and literally a few minutes later I received instructions on how to access the building and the room.    Arrived at the building and true to their word the instructions were spot on.  Within a minute I was in the apartment.    I was in no 16 which is designed for up to 2 people.  I think although cosy it was perfectly suitable for 2.    There is a separate shower and toilet.  A well-equipted kitchen with plenty of workspace.  A proper cooker and hob and a microwave to compliment.  The fridge had a pint of milk and bottle of mineral water which was most appreciated.  A box of biscuits was also provided which was a lovely touch.  Wi-fi was free and fast and very reliable.  It did not flinch once during the 4 nights I was there.  A small sofa and coffee table was provided.  It's nice to have somewhere to sit which is not at the end of a bed which is the case in most hotels.  The bed and covers were lovely.  I had walked around 20 miles the previous weekend and I was aching all over.  The comfy bed and bed linen was the best thing I have experienced in a very long time.  The only minor grumble was the heating.  They use storage heaters that heat up at night and release heat during the day.  They had been switched off so the apartment was quite cold on the first night.  I did, however, work out that turning one of the cooker rings on took the edge off.  After that, it was lovely and cosy.  Also, the toaster kept tripping the RCD.  Not their fault, just something that happens.  Ideally, there should be a non-RCD side.  4 great nights were had and I was sad to leave.  I definitely will be back in the future.

The little supermarket right near the apartment has everything you would need. However, even though we were in there in October, the room was hot and there was no way to cool it unless you opened the doors or windows. This was not practical for night and too noisy. There was no tea towel, so we bought one. For two weeks we were given one towel each. So that meant having to make sure they were washed early enough to get them dry. Two towels would have been more practical. If we wanted to have our sheets washed during this time, it mean another UK50.00. This was unexpected and not usual for long stays. The bath is set quite high and was slippery. Both of us nearly slipped trying to get in and out and so had to buy a rubber mat. Not everyone would find that a problem but we are short. Lastly, we had to pay a security fee of UK500. This was not as easy as stated. In the end the payment went to our account for Aust $956.00. It was slow to be returned and again and was not automatic.

I stayed there a week this month and this was my experience: 1. The single and shared rooms in the basement are highly avoidable. Badly ventilated and noisy, they do not have lift access and you get there through dingy passages and many steps, so too bad if you have luggage.  2. My room had a noisy heating mechanism, which sounded like loud water droplets the first two nights and then nothing short of a train track on the third. This can be a problem with old buildings, but my written and oral complaints to more than 5 people at the reception and maintenance went unheard. I was sleepless for most of the week, and the response of the staff was between tepid to simply ignoring my polite repeated requests for repair. A room change was not possible since the hostel was fully booked. 3. Knowing their location and their price, the Indian YMCA student hostel knows that they can get by with taking their guests for a ride. This they do by charging the full tariff amount at checkin (not checkout like most hotels/hostels) and then you are simply trapped into staying there.  4. The food timings are restricted, the chefs mostly loud and rude in telling you to finish up eating, and the dishes are poor. The rate card for guests at meals is simply not worth it. Coming from India, I can say that the Indian food here is really below average.  5. IF you stay a week, your room is not even cleaned once. Only if you stay more than a week do you get cleaning - why these strange rules? Overall, avoid staying here despite the great price and location. It is uncomfortable and not worth ruining the rest of your time in London.…","['Family', 'Centrally Located']","['100Great for walkersGrade: 100 out of 100', '273Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '40Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']","Wifi, Paid wifi, Free breakfast, Restaurant, Non-smoking hotel, Laundry service, Flatscreen TV, Non-smoking rooms","#184 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",124,"[28, 50, 25, 5, 16]","{'All languages': 124, 'English': 112, 'German': 6, 'Portuguese': 3}","['ymca indian student hotel london', 'United KingdomEnglandLondonFitzrovia', '120']"

Owing to the onset of Covid-19 and lockdown, the fair was cancelled and fully refunded. My booked parking space was also then refunded although there was no obligation to do this.   Our Earl's Court Studios reservation (booked nearly 3 weeks previously) was non-refundable, but as the nearly £600 had not yet been debited from my account I called them and explained the situation. I asked if the booking could be rescheduled in June, the date of our next fair, or if they could give us vouchers for a later date - even if the vouchers were only a certain percentage of the original cost. Earl's Court Studios said they would get back to me.  I then received an in-booking email stating that as the money had been debited there was nothing they could do. I checked my account and found the amount pending and immediately emailed back to say that this was not the case at the time I spoke to them. They replied that they were entitled to debit my account whenever they chose to do so. They also informed me that as my friend's country was not yet officially on lockdown, she could still come over and not lose her booking. This was so impractical as surely they realised that there was a good chance she would be stranded here away from her family and hemorrhaging money she couldn't afford to lose. In fact, lockdown occurred a few days later and this would have been the case if she had done this. In fact, after Earl's Court Studios initial reply, she seriously considered it, despite there being no fair and few clients around. She has called her airline, though, and despite the possibility of there being no refund, they nevertheless sent her vouchers for her trip to be used within a year.   I then was given the manager's number and he said he would see what he could do and get back to me, which he didn't. I called him a number of times over the next few days and left messages. He eventually called me back saying he had dropped his phone and that he had dropped his phone and was having some problems with it, but it was working absinthe now. I explained to him yet again about our reservations and he said he would look into it and text me shortly. He later sent me a text (on the problem phone) containing a sad face emoji and saying No Refund owing to T&Cs. No mention of a voucher or offering to delay the booking, just basically a sad face emoji.  I very much regret having booked with this company owing to their unprofessional conduct. I'm particularly shocked that they falsely claimed the money had been deducted from my account and hence no refund when they clearly only initiated the process after I called them. As both my friend and I are self-employed, we are particularly grateful to the various businesses, both large and small, who, as a result of Covid-19, either refunded money or sent through vouchers to use their services at a later date. We will certainly go back to these companies and tell our friends and colleagues about them. Only Earl's Court Studios treated us with a lack of courtesy. We didn't even request a refund, only to reschedule days or some sort of voucher.…","['', 'Residential Neighbourhood', 'English, Russian']","['100Great for walkersGrade: 100 out of 100', '84Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '11Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']","Free High Speed Internet (WiFi), Wifi, Non-smoking hotel, Kitchenette, Microwave, Refrigerator, Flatscreen TV, Bath / shower, Non-smoking rooms, Family rooms","#137 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",209,"[48, 101, 33, 13, 14]","{'All languages': 209, 'English': 133, 'Spanish': 20, 'Chinese (Sim.)': 16}","['£232 - £301 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) ', 'earls court studios hotel london', 'United KingdomEnglandLondonEarls Court', '15']"

When we arrived, we were immediately upgraded to a larger room which was more like a suite then a double bedroom! For the price we paid you will struggle to find accommodation as good as this in East London, (we paid £194). I think the reviews reflect old management and older rooms which are still in the process of being updated that some guests have stayed in.   However, food for thought for management is that: The rooms don't appear to be sound proofed, this could be looked into. Not all the plug sockets worked which is just me being fussy as I like to have my phone next to my bed But most importantly, your reception staff don't pick up the phone when people call and when they do, I just got ""hello"" and a very monotone and unhelpful conversation. Either hire new staff who care about first impressions or offer some training to them as they're not helping with resolving initial concerns. When we arrived everyone was lovely so this I'm sure could be easily resolved? Would have scored higher if initial contact was better, shame!

It is located immediately next door to a medical centre which is the last terrace property of the row. Parking is provided off-road and although limited, there were no issues with parking during my stay. Do be aware though that the entrance is via a narrow, gated driveway so those with larger vehicles need to take care.  The hotel is close to main transport links; in particular the A406 (Gunnersbury Avenue) and the M4 motorway. Close by there is also both London Underground and Overground train stations.  On arrival, I was politely greeted at the door by Beata, who provided me with the keys and information regarding my stay. There is the offer of a breakfast, but not having it I am unable to comment. I was also offered and provided with the WiFi information.  I was accommodated in a single room on the second floor of this property. The room contained a small table (kettle and plenty of tea and coffee, etc.), a chair and a free-standing wardrobe (with hangers supplied). The room also had an internal (no windows) en-suite which although small was actually well positioned, with shampoo and shower gel sachets and had a large shower cubicle (no elbows against the wall) with FANTASTIC water pressure. What made the room stand-out however, was the large skylight in the ceiling which in July meant that the room was wonderfully bright for working within the room (e.g. on a laptop, etc). The window also opened nice and wide, allowing the room to be kept cool and airy. The position of the property allows the front windows a nice view of Twyford Gardens, a park opposite. Although the road at the front of the property (Uxbridge Road) is clearly a main transport route; even with the windows open (due to summer humidity) there was little noticeable disturbance during the day or night.  In the local area is a typical high street, a large Morrisons retail store and a short walking distance away; a Tesco Express.

Previously we've always stayed in hotels but now that the number of Grandkids is growing we needed more room. Hotels would only offer us two separate rooms so we decided to try an apartment. On arrival our initial worry was about the area but it's fine. Deptford Bridge station is a three minute walk and there is a Tesco Express a minute a way. We had the downstairs apartment which was great, two showers (one with a bath) which was really useful with four kids to get ready each day, good size bedrooms with French doors out in to the garden. My biggest complaint is that because it is a downstairs apartment the owners could make sure all the light bulbs are working and of sufficient brightness, some of the rooms were very dingy.  Although everything was ready for us when we arrived there were a few items I would consider essential in a holiday let missing: Tea towels, replacement bin bags, only one spare loo roll.  The two biggest issue I had was firstly that the confirmation email turned up with just a couple of days to spare and went in to my junk email so it was purely by chance I saw it. An SMS turned up also but only after I had responded to the email. I was told I would need to bring ID and various other items yet on arrival to the apartment and even still we haven't seen a single person to check in or out with!  Secondly and probably the biggest gripe is the wireless, it is next to useless. The kids all struggled to access them social media and I couldn't access emails or work so that caused me major issues.  Coverage is fine so I'm assuming it is simply restricted to make it pointless!! To summarise we would use the apartments again with the kids as its location, space and general quality was perfect for us but I would hope the owners thought about what their clients would want and need when they're on holiday for a week.…",[],"['85Good for walkersGrade: 85 out of 100', '223Restaurantswithin 0.75 miles', '47Attractionswithin 0.75 miles']",,"#475 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",2,"[0, 2, 0, 0, 0]","{'All languages': 2, 'English': 1, 'Dutch': 1}",['United KingdomEnglandLondon']

It literally is the smallest room a double bed could actually fit into. If the room where a fraction of an inch smaller, the bed would prevent the door from opening. The bed is stuffed in from wall to wall, with a little space near the foot (as the room is L shaped) to fit a 2 1/2 foot wide desk. this all leaves a small path, the width of the door, to stand in. The room has no TV, no kettle, no bedside table, no desk lamp (the choice in lighting is either full on bright ceiling lights, or nothing at all) no room tidying service (thought the nice gentleman who cleans the shared bathroom emptied my bin for me when I asked him). There is no place to put clothing except for a hook on the door and a drawer in the bed frame that only opens a third of the way before interfering with the desk support.   Cleanliness: the room seemed clean enough at first, apart from a few smudges on the white paint and an odd ""x' written on the wall in pencil. However, after fishing out from under the bed a small item i had dropped, I came up with numerous dust bunnies, plastic packaging, and a half smoked cigarette (!). The shared bathroom was kept very clean by the above mentioned gentleman. By my second night, however, the bathroom was developing a slow drain problem in the sink and toilet, so much so that the toilet became unusable (threatening to overflow) on the morning of my checkout.   Speaking of the bathroom, I didn't think that sharing would be a big deal, but due to my neighbours' tendency to take sequential long showers on my first night and morning, I found the downstairs toilet of the next-door offices out of desperation.   Finding the cigarette end in my room got me thinking - If there were a fire, how would I get out of this place! You know - without using the lift, which we're not to do in the case of fire. The apartment is just a hallway with doors, and with no indication whether or not one of these doors leads to a staircase. in event of a fire, I can only imagine people fumbling around in the dark trying each door to find if one of them leads to a fire escape.

On the first night the bed broke, and throughout our stay this would not be the only bed to break.

It was hazardous staying there as the wall gave way to the curtain pole as a result of the damp wall crumbling .

Therefore expect human faeces quite literally at your door step as well as the sound of druggies shouting at each other throughout the night. Cleanliness standards were disgusting. The windows were so dirty it looked like there was a film over them. The cooker knobs were filthy and covered in a thick layer of gunk. As I mentioned before, the walls were stained, carpets were dirty and linens were often adorned with small stains. The hob was broken and had to use a match/plastic lighter to light the fire. They place the key box for the apartments on the stairs of one of the properties so expect to have many confused guests attempting to enter your property using their keys.

I just asked nicely to rebook the stay but they told me I could sit on my money, it’s non refundable and non changeable.

This is my first poor review on TripAdvisor.  It was such a terrible experience, I am writing now despite staying there almost one year ago (July 2017).  Perhaps things have changed, but if the ownership/management is the same, I would stay away from this booking.  There were a wealth of problems, but the most critical were room access and double charging.  I was asked to leave cash payment in person (no invoice provided) and then was charged by credit card at a later date.  After contacting the business, I was advised a credit card refund was coming.  More than a month later, no action was taken.  I finally rectified the situation with a Visa dispute.","['English, Hindi, Italian, Lithuanian and 1 more']","['100Great for walkersGrade: 100 out of 100', '232Restaurantswithin 0.3 miles', '43Attractionswithin 0.3 miles']","Free High Speed Internet (WiFi), Airport transportation, Non-smoking hotel, Shared kitchen, Private check-in / check-out","#1,039 of 2,117 Speciality lodging in London",11,"[0, 1, 1, 3, 6]","{'All languages': 11, 'German': 3, 'English': 3, 'Spanish': 2}",['United KingdomEnglandLondonEast End / East London / Whitechapel']
