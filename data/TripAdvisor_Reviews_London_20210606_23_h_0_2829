Lobby area is spacious if want to get out of the room to work. Wifi connects without issue   I would say the location is OK. Across Thames from London so either walk 2.5 kilometers or take taxi or tube. Waterloo station is about 5 minute walk but may have to connect to get to area you want. Uber is great but taxis not in area.   Breakfast is actually pretty good for being included.  Work out room is average at best.   Hotel is good for price point but realize you may have transport costs if a tourist.   Many basic restaurants in area for take away or pub food. ",Date of stay: March 2018,4.0

NOR do the rooms have windows which open! 19 degrees might sound like a pretty acceptable temperature, however, the sun had been shining into our (admittedly beautifully placed) corner room all day so after nearly two hours of the a/c being on, it still actually felt more like it was 26 degrees in there.

The rooms are a little small, but nice, with all the expected amenities - a superb small bathroom - shower only, and a functional and comfortable work space.   This hotel is clearly focused at short term worker stays - aimed at residents/nationals. Not really geared for international visitors.  There is no room service. Breakfast is pretty average and I couldn't help like feeling I was in a college cafeteria - trays and troughs, and probably the worst coffee I've had in recent times.

We've stayed here a couple of times with our two small children when visiting London. It's about a 4 min walk from Waterloo Station giving great access to the underground. The staff are very helpful and friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  The restuarant has very good reviews (although not to our taste) and it transforms into the most amazing self serve breakfast in the mornings. They serve everything you could wish for on a hot and cold buffet. The only very minor criticism we have is that a family room doesn't leave any space really to move about. It's filled by the two (very comfy) double beds. We may look to book interconnecting rooms next‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2016,5.0

It is a little pricy, like all London hotels, but it's location is great as it is a block from Waterloo station.  Waterloo has four Tube (subway) lines crossing here and a major train platform to get further out into the country.  The rooms are smaller than American sized, but that is typical in Europe.  The hotel provides a free big English breakfast free.  The fare includes:  Eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, baked beans, stewed tomatoes cereal, muffins, croissants, fruit, waffles and more.   Beverages like O.J., Coffee, milk also.  The hotel staff was perfect, responded to any request quickly.  The maid service was great as well.  I would stay here again.

I arrived earlier than check-in but my room was ready--something that will always endear me to a hotel. The hotel is new (opened in February) and that shows in a positive way: room is clean, modern etc.  The location is excellent, a 5-minute walk from Waterloo Station, which made things very easy to get around by both bus and tube. The breakfast buffet was very nice, and the computers in the lobby (though occasionally occupied by game-playing children) helped plan my days.
