No air con. So we couldn’t block out the bathroom noises. Breakfast time was very limited and they rarely had space for us to eat and would not allow us to take food to the room, so we missed the free breakfast every day- sometimes I could grab some cheese packets and take them outside to eat them. Sheets and pillows were clean but very worn. Towels very worn. Upon arriving in London and seeing the room, i did a hotel search only to find I was paying a lot more for the hotel than if I had done a last minute booking. I was paying three times more.

If you want a reasonably priced place to be a roof over your head at the end of the day, then Surtrees is your hotel.  The rooms are quite small and basic, don't expect to find tea and coffee making machines or a hair dryer, but on the up-side the staff are friendly and will try to help where-ever possible.  Breakfast runs from 8a.m until 9 a.m ,it's worth getting down early to avoid having to sit and wait for a table or share with strangers.    One thing I was impressed with was the professionalism of staff when responding to my emails.  I did have to change my reservation details a couple of times and had queries about the hotel.  All my emails were answered promptly.  Thanks for…",Date of stay: January 2008,3.0

I found Surtees to be clean, well managed, and comfortable.  While the room was small, the only problem I had with it was a lack of storage space for my luggage.  The bathroom was across the hall and had such a low ceiling that I couldn't stand up straight at the toilet.  It was on the top floor so I had to carry a large case up a small and steep staircase.  Do not stay at Surtees if you are not able to climb stairs easily.  Even if your room is on the ground floor you will need to climb stairs to get in and out and to get to the dining room.  Breakfast was simple but good.  The staff were excellent.  Overall we found…",Date of stay: August 2007,3.0

Surtees Hotel fit the bill for us.  We researched several others in this price range on trip advisor and they all had terrible reviews.  The room and bathroom (down the stairs) were tiny but clean.  We had packed light so finding room for our luggage wasn't a problem.  Our room faced the street.  I wore earplugs at night but my husband didn't have trouble sleeping through what noise there was.  The staff was friendly and allowed us to keep our luggage there after we had checked out.  For us it was a 10 minute walk to Victoria Station (maybe we walk slow-others have written 5 minutes) and we took the tube everywhere.  We would stay there again. ",Date of stay: August 2007,4.0

It's in a great location (among many other B&Bs in Victoria) - we could walk to Buckingham Palace  and Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, London Eye etc were also walkable but we chose to take the tube (as we'd bought a daily ticket we thought we'd make the most of it!). We also walked to Harrods (20min walk). Public transport is expensive so this was a real drawcard for us. The hotel is 5mins walk from Victoria station.  The rooms at the hotel were on the small side but very clean. Beds were comfy.  The breakfast was great - toast, cereal, cheese, sweet muffins (including chocolate ones), fruit, orange juice, tea, coffee etc (we were impressed with this as most other hotels we stayed in that had a continental breakfast only gave us a crossiant and…",Date of stay: June 2007,5.0

I went to London recently with 2 of my girlfriends.  We're all married, have various 30somthing ages, and are used to staying in very nice places.  We found this very reasonably priced hoted through Ryan Air's website.  We were looking for 2 nights in a Guest House, conveniently located at a great price.  The Surtees was just what we asked for!  It is a 5 minute walk from Victoria station.  You can catch the tube, the big red tour bus, or walk to see the musical ""Wicked"" at the Apollo theater (right across from Victoria and the abosolute BEST musical I have ever had the privilege to see!).

The reception desk was also a kitchen/dining room/common room. Didn't look very professional at all Went down to check out for my flight early in the morning and found them sleeping on a pull out couch.   They also gave us no towels to shower with. I also asked for a double bed, since I was travelling with my partner, and they shoved two singles together.   The location was good, 5 mins from Victoria Station.

The whole neighbourhood is lined with hotels.  The Surtees Hotel is poorly managed.  The girl at the front desk let her friends party in the empty rooms, and the walls were like paper.  When I complained the next day, the manager brought her into dining room and screamed at her while I tried to eat my breakfast (they advertise Full English breakfast, but all I got was cornflakes).  Incidentally, I woke up one night due to bedbugs.   For 40 pounds per night, you can do a lot better than this place.",None,1.0
