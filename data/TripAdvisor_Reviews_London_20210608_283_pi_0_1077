I have stayed in many Premier Inns and this is in one of the poorer parts of London. There is a Brewers Fayre next door,  but having walked through the connecting door from reception we walked straight out the front again because it just did not look hygienic enough for us to want to eat there. There is an Asda supermarket over the road and we had our breakfast in there which cost less than a fiver. Apart from that there is nothing else within walking distance, although of course the DLR train station is next door. Regular trains to Canning Town where you change on to the tube.

Interesting inn and very popular. Interesting in that it has two  blocks of rooms on the same site. The pleasant receptionist told me that there are plans to build another block due to popularity. The inn does not at this time have a Thyme restaurant so we eat next door at a Brewers Fayre . To be fair it was the school holidays and it was very busy with young families. So if you want a quiet meal after a hard days work then investigate eating elsewhere.

Check in was easy, quick and friendly. Our room (31) was on the first floor overlooking the carpark and wasn't facing the main road opposite the ASDA store, so probably quiet in comparison.
