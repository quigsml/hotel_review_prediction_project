They took payment in full. They cancelled as the hotel was not reopening in time for my stay. When I rung in October to request a refund I was told they had 90 days. After I rung in 90 days I was told to email. I have 3 times without even the courtesy of a response.

Still can’t believe they did it. It’s the main reason we chose the Holiday Inn Oxford Circus, as we knew these were people we could rely on. Yes, the rooms and furniture are not new, which is usually my biggest pet peeve, but in this case there were so many other good things, I almost forgot about that.   People here mention the location, and they’re right that it’s perfect, right behind Debenhmans. HOWEVER, what I loved: Very quiet, even though our room was facing the street + No bad smells, which should not be taken for granted in London hotels + the room at night can  get dark, blocking the lights from outside= We actually had very restful sleep. Which is not what I can say for several upscale hotels I’ve stayed at. In fact I had a headache on all the nights that I stayed, but in the morning I was so much better, exactly because of how restful the whole thing was and that’s what was the most important.  Thank you, Paul and the rest of the staff.…",Date of stay: December 2020,4.0

Wouldn’t even allow to put our coats down. We spoke to the manager who seemed to care less. He gave no apologies or was not sincere. All he did was inform us they aren’t allowed to do that, yet they still did with no repercussion. By far the worst hotel I ever stayed in. Don’t ever stay here.

What I did find encouraging is they chose to have an upgraded tv in this room with a “flat screen” from 2003.  As I’ve posted photos to ensure credibility, the lack of being updated was probably the worst part. Carpets looked original with tears and holes, curtains stained, outdated furniture and mold/warped tile in the bathroom.   If I wasn’t paying such a heavy price tag for the location, I’d say don’t ever stay here.

Asking to take a plate where my food is still on is not okay, and they were almost offended when we said ""No I'm eating from this plate"".

This hotel was just the ticket for our short three day trip to London.  Good location, close to the Oxford Street shops, nice and clean (spotless in fact).  The beds were soooooooo comfy.  Staff were efficient and polite, and when we asked for extra pillows thats just what we got.  We were in a room on the front of the hotel and we could hear the traffic but then again we are in the middle of London.  Breakfast was all you can eat and was a good start to the day. The hotel is your average Holiday Inn (not posh) but for the price we paid it was well worth the money. ",None,3.0

Internet connection is 12.50 pounds per day. 2.  Internet connection is wireless but slower than dial-up if it works at all. 3.  Shower gets scalding hot randomly.  If your head's under it. . .prepare for pain. 4.  Shower curtain doesn't weigh enough so the water pressure causes it to billow in while you're showering.  Prepare to wash while keeping it from wrapping around you. 5.  Sink basin is not designed for the water pressure.  Expect to get soaked each time you turn it on. 6.  Phone in my room was so loosely connected to the wall that no calls could come in or out.  Got no messages even when they were left. 7.  Eat elsewhere and you'll be fine in that department. ,Date of stay: September 2005,2.0

Nice foyer, check-in was problem-free but the room was a bit disappointing. It could have done with a serious sprucing-up. Room smelt of stale smoke when specifically asked for a non-smoking room. Manager didn't resolve this problem, said there was nothing they could do, whilst shrugging shoulders and looking thouroughly bored with me.

It is your typical holiday inn- it doesn't have much personality and the staff are pretty miserable. The buffet breakfast is really nice if you are prepared to pay the high price, although I felt the breakfasting room was too small and felt a little rushed by staff to vacate the table.  The rooms were clean, the shower nice and hot and the beds comfortable. As mentioned in previous reviews the staff could do with a little customer service training, and I sometimes got the feeling they didn't quite understand me when I spoke to them (the staff are all different nationalities).
