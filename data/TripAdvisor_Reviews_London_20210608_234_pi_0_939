We walked to the venue in 25-30 minutes along the river or it’s only 3 stops on the tube to Hammersmith.  The hotel is in a great location away from the busyness of central London. There is a tube station (Turnham Green) about 1 mile away which took 15 minutes to walk to, through a residential area and the high street. It took roughly 20 minutes or so to get into central London on the district line, even less to get to Kensington. Great room, clean and tidy hotel. We also had breakfast which was good.

We will return.,"I had booked this hotel some months prior to our stay so got a good room rate.  My wife and I were staying overnight in order to see a concert at the Royal Albert Hall.  It was a pleasant surprise to find 9 disabled parking spaces out the front. There was no parking charge for Blue Badge holders which was another bonus.  Check in was completed quickly and we were allocated an accessible room as per my request.  The ensuite bathroom was quite big and had the appropriate safety features. The only downside was the presence of a shower curtain which is a pet hate of mine.  It would have been much better if it was a wet room like some other Premier Inns that I have stayed at.
