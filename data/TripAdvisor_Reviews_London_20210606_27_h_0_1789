A special shout out to Delia, who helped rectify a few things for me, thank you! I liked the grab and go breakfast set up, as I hate filling in forms the night before. On the second part of my stay, my room was upgraded and I had a fabulous view of London. The hotel offers a good variety of food, especially given the current circumstances, but they do add on a 12.5% service charge, so I explored local eateries nearby. A typical Hilton room that lived up to my high expectations, what more could you want.",Date of stay: December 2020,5.0

Let me preface this by saying, as a Hilton Gold member, I stay at Hilton properties 30-50 nights a year.  I have a pretty good sense of what to expect, and my stay at the Hilton Islington Angel was my worst Hilton brand stay of the year.  The staff have a terrible apathetic attitude.  Even the simplest asks require 2-3 follow ups. phone calls to reception and housekeeping never get answered.  Completely ignore messages sent through the Hilton messenger app.   Need a toothbrush or extra towels? Too bad, you need to go to reception and pick them up yourself.   Lack of basic amenities – e.g. ran out of shoe shine kits  No status recognition as a Hilton Gold, not even the minimum benefit of a complimentary bottle of water.   Stained curtains in the room, towel rack detached from the wall and just hanging there?  Thought they would have noticed this when they cleaned the room?

We chose a junior suite for an absolute bargain rate and it had everything we needed including a travel cot. We were able to use the bar for drinks as the exec lounge was closed. We felt completely safe in the hotel and used the Hilton app for check in and for our door key. The rate also allowed for cancellation up until the day of our stay. This is so important in these uncertain times. The proximity to a reasonable car park was also a bonus.  Overall we were delighted with our stay.,Date of stay: September 2020,5.0

The restaurant in the Hilton wasanother story,we were there at 11am and not many in there dining, the food was ok but the service was terrible. I had to get up several times to get the waiters attention including getting the bill. They just weren't paying attention or poorly trained,not sure which but with all the great spots to dine in Islington they need to up their game.

I guess I could have asked for fresh ones but that seems such a waste when there were a good dozen or so fried eggs there cooked.

It is right by the Angel Station, which goes strait to King's Cross. It was not noisy and the room was nice. However, they tried charging us 20 pounds for a 15 minute phone call. When we took down the sign by the phone that says ""Free 60 minutes on the phone"" to the front desk, Elisa (spelling?) rolled her eyes at us, snatched the sign away, and took it off. She was condescending to us. The staff were horrendous and they were never willing to help or smile with anything. We would not go back because of how rude they all were.

The rooms were quite modern and kept well maintained.  The beds were comfortable. Close to some restaurants and pubs. The hotel was within minutes of the Underground Angel stop on the Northern line.
