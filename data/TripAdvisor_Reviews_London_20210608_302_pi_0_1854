Very easy to get to, travelled from Brighton to Victoria and then was straight on the tube from there. 30 seconds away from the tube station, 10 mins in an Uber (around £7) to Westfields. Room was clean, hotel was quiet, bed was comfy. Ideal location as not too far from on the tube to go central. Food at hotel was not great especially for the price but there’s loads of food places at Westfield and also a Chinese down the road from hotel that we ate in and was amazing food!

Things started badly and got worse if that is possible. On the walk up to the front of the hotel I noted around 4 men who looked like rough drinkers consuming alcohol in the car park. This was an immediate red flag, but I carried on with my husband and 14 year old son, to check into our booked family room. The receptionist seemed preoccupied, unable to remember names and possibly the least interested receptionist I have ever met at a Premier Inn. We got the key and went to our room.

The walls are thin and you can hear anything. I thought here we go. As soon as I arrived I had to go back down and tell the staff how noisy it was. They rushed out to move the people on. Ok returning to my room I could not here another noise, almost like an animal trapped somewhere. I had to go and investigate. Turns out it was bad piping in the bathroom.

These hotel rooms are not cheap and  not to have a suppy of these is surprising.

I actually scouted a number of hotels during previous stays in London before choosing this one, as London is quite large, and although the metro system is extensive, it takes quite some time to move around and you need to consider where you want to spend your time (definitely not on the trains!). The main advantage of this hotel is that it is very close to the Earl's court station, from where you can easily reach central London and Heathrow, and you can also walk (<15 minutes) to the natural history and science museums (and the V&A, which may not be the most interesting for kids, but is a must for adults).

The location is good, right near the station and the breakfast was fantastic as usual but the rest of the stay was disappointing. Our double bed sagged in the middle, which we reported after the first night but was not fixed for our 2nd night. Our shower leaked, either through an insufficient curtain or leaking plumbing, unsure which. Either way our bathroom floor flooded after showers. Again we reported this after the first morning but it did it again the next morning.

The reception and breakfast / dinner areas are modern, probably the nicest bit of the hotel to be honest.  However, the rooms are a HUGE disappointment, not only small, but not nice like in a Hub Hotel by Premier Inn, but terribly old fashioned and poorly appointed. The bathrooms are truly awful, and can only be remedied by immediate refurbishment. The bath is probably half the length of a normal bath and the shower curtain is constantly in the way. It would be better to remove the baths completely and go for a huge walk in shower as Premier Inn have done in their magnificent Hub Hotel concept.

Sadly this allowed all of the the outside noise to join us inside the room despite being on the 11th floor, All night long! It was the most basic premier inn we have ever stayed in but the most expensive. It was actually more travelodge than premier.

We headed out to the game and arrived back to find this hadn't been done so we had to share a double bed for the night.

Whether it was lack of guests or good sound suppression but we didn't hear anybody. Also nice not to have housekeeping knocking on your door from before 9am as happens in a lot of (more expensive) hotels these days. Pros:  cheap for London, we got an advance price of £49.

Reception staff were friendly and helpful.  10 min slow walk to Hammersmith tube station.  Downsides: Only had a small bath and the shower over the bath wasn't the best, the water tended to spray all over the place. ",Date of stay: January 2007,5.0

Our room was basic and smelled a little odd but it just about sufficed for the few hours that we needed it before an early morning flight from Heathrow. We arrived at 1pm but were unable to access our room, so had to pile our bags into a storage cupboard and come back later. The location is good for Ravenscourt Park tube, but if you are considering this hotel because it is near to Heathrow, be warned that you will have to change trains to get on the Piccadilly line.

Our room (we were given a family room for 2 people because all others were booked up) was on the 11th floor, it had a superb view and was huge - really spacious and airy.  Everything was pristine clean, tidy and perfect.  The bed was comfy and fresh, and I slept like a log (besides a couple of slamming doors at about 5am!)  The best thing by far about this hotel is the staff - I have stayed in many hotels in London but never met any so friendly before.  The reception staff were very helpful, particularly with helping us sort out the congestion charge - but by far, the restaurant staff were exceptional, both at breakfast and dinner.

We paid $123/night (US dollars, including all taxes, through Octopus travel), which is very inexpensive for London in August.  The hotel's advertised rates are MUCH higher (which is very disturbing!).    This hotel is a bit of an eye sore in the Hammersmith area of London.  My friend commented that it looks like a Soviet bloc-style office building, which was a great description of the place. The room itself was small and needed a lot of updating (e.g. paint, linens, furniture, carpet).  Surprisingly, the lobby bar area had a fun and funky decor.

However the reservation staff were happy to take my copy of the printed on-line reservation confirmation and I was allowed to use the room from 09:45.  Room was clean, everything worked, great view (floor 9) and very convenient to Ravenscourt Park District line tube station.  Breakfast was Ok and the staff were friendly. I didn't take an evening meal - there are restaurants within a couple of minutes walk (Indian / Vietnamese / pizza).  It is quite convenient for Olympia - either via Earls Court or walk from Barons Court station. If I was needing a hotel in this area I would consider re-visiting this one. ",None,3.0

It's in zone 2 of the Tube but only takes about 30 minutes to reach downtown London with a Tube stop 2 blocks from the hotel. Continental breakfast was good and was delivered to our room.  The staff was lovely and helpful with any questions we had. This was one on the most pleasant hotels in Europe I've stayed in.
