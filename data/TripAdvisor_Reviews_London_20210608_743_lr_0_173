For the price I paid (¬£37) overall from the 3 days I stayed there I was quite happy with everything.   Checking in is swift, the staff are quite friendly and if you need any help just ask and they are more than happy to help. If you need to shower or intend on using one you can rent out a towel from the front desk for ¬£2 (that‚Äôs if you‚Äôve forgotten one or just didn‚Äôt pack one ) they also have drinks and snacks at the front desk for a decent price if you don‚Äôt want to leave the hostel to grab something little, there are also lockers there but you will need to buy your own lock (preferably one with a code) if you want to use one.   So the rooms... They‚Äôre actually pretty good ! The sheets were clean and I really liked the fact that the plug sockets had USB ports so I could charge other gadgets, the bed was pretty comfy for what I was paying and It‚Äôs similar to sleeping on a sofa. I bought my own sleeping liner because I wanted some protection just in case the sheets weren‚Äôt clean. The first night was a little restless because everyone including myself was getting used to the environment which is understandable. In my dormitory I had 7 other people and I just kept to myself and always made sure that my stuff out the way just to be respectful of others using the room, luckily I didn‚Äôt have any weirdos in the room and it was just fellow travellers ! So I was quite happy !   My only complaint about the rooms would be that they were a little cold in the evening, I don‚Äôt know if this was just a heating issue or just me but if you have yourself wrapped up and maybe throw on a hoodie you will be absolutely finest  Okay so breakfast it‚Äôs pretty simple (obviously) you have cereal, toast etc it‚Äôs quite basic but it‚Äôs free and I personally had zero complaints at the end of the day it‚Äôs a free meal if you really don‚Äôt like it you can go get yourself overpriced food from Central London but assuming you‚Äôre staying here because you‚Äôre on a budget wouldn‚Äôt make that much sense now would it ?  If you do want to make yourself meals throughout the day certainly can just make sure that you label stuff clearly and tidy up.   Free wifi is available but it tends to cut out every now and again which is annoying if you‚Äôre trying to do something.  The showers were tolerable they weren‚Äôt really that hot but It was warm enough to get yourself cleaned up and that‚Äôs all that mattered to me.  The nearest tube station is North Lambeth and it takes around 20 mins to get to most places alternatively you can walk but it‚Äôs gonna take you double the time. I must say though the location of this hostel being in Waterloo was really convenient as  everything was already on your doorstep   As far as this review goes there‚Äôs honestly not that much else to talk about but if you want to try a hostel or you‚Äôre looking to save some money then honestly this isn‚Äôt a bad choice at all ! I give it a thumbs up and I may consider returning in the future üëåüèº‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2020,4.0

The ""receptionist"" is as unfriendly as can be. The plaster on the walls going up to the rooms is falling off and is being held up by big patches of sello tape! Dark stains tell the tale of none or skimpy cleaning. Beds couldn't be any narrower, an obese person would NOT fit in, and there is no way of sitting up without bumping your head.  The kitchen consists of one 2-plate cooker and a microwave. Dishes tend to be dirty and/or full of suds. Breakfast consists of toast, margarine and jam.  Toilets are not very clean and the tiles in the showers are full of mould.  A thoroughly disgusting experience , hard to understand it has a licence to operate as a hostel.

Urgh! ,"I was in London for a week and decided to book a hostel in an attempt to save a bit of money. Lesson learned! You definitely get what you pay for and in the case of this place, you‚Äôll get a whole lot more too - mostly bugs.   First of all, to be absolutely fair to them, the staff are really lovely. They‚Äôre helpful and super accommodating but that doesn‚Äôt disguise the fact that the place is a complete flea pit. I‚Äôve stayed in hostels before, in various countries and at various price levels, so it wasn‚Äôt that my expectations were unrealistic. It genuinely is the case that this place is filthy. The layers of grime and dirt on the floors and woodwork was disgusting, especially in the kitchen. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to use the shower (too gross) and the ‚Äòcontinental breakfast‚Äô is just a pile of bread next to a toaster with a sugar bowl full of cheap margarine and some plastic knives to spread it. Vile.   Booked for a week, stayed one night, gotten bitten to death by the disgusting bed bug type things that were crawling all over the room and then left the next morning. Seriously, I just never went back. Couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of putting my foot in the door again. I think I‚Äôd have been better off sleeping in the park! There are loads of hostels in London for a similar price where you‚Äôll get a much more pleasant stay. I advise you to avoid this one and look elsewhere. ‚Ä¶",Date of stay: November 2019,1.0

So much so, I chose not to finish my stay as I refused to stay in the conditions.  There was only one shower on each level, which were cramp and dirty. This was to be used by males and females, so there was no privacy.  It was super impractical as there were no lockers inside the room, only downstairs, so to keep going back and forth locking your belongings was difficult.  The rooms themselves were small and the bunks were loud and hard to manoeuvre.   All in all very disappointed in my stay and would not recommend to a friend.",Date of stay: October 2019,1.0

The very next day, a heated argument broke out around 2:00 a.m. in my room, in which two guests ended up getting evicted because they hit each other. I made the reasonable decision of booking another accommodation and requested to check out early. Not only did the host refuse to let me check out early, he wouldn't even give me any refund. I even enlisted Airbnb, who helped book the reservation, to mediate the situation. But the host wouldn't budge. In the end, I made the difficult decision of cancelling the reservation, which resulted in no refund.  Apart from that experience, I'm willing to explain other aspects of the hostel.

I've read many negative reviews about it, but gave it a try and was not disappointed. The beds were clean, comfy, I had my own private power socket and light. The bunk beds are a bit squeaky and I believe it may get a bit too crowd when it is fully occupied. The only con I can mention is their website say they offer lockers, but, unless you have your own lock, you'll have to buy one at the counter (or elsewhere), otherwise the locker is there, but there is no lock.

My partner and I specifically booked this hostel through Hostelworld because of the kitchen described in the listing. We are backpackers who are travelling on a shoestring, so a kitchen is really important to us from a money-saving perspective, especially when staying in London where eating out is very expensive. Note: this place not only has the generic Hostelworld ""self-catering facilities"" listed, but actually goes on to describe their kitchen as a feature of their listing, so this was one of the major reasons we booked here.

My travel partner and I chose this hostel because of the price and location. The beds were some of the least expensive we could find, and the location was close the city center. The hostel wouldn't have been such a disappointment, but they advertised that they had services that weren't in fact offered.   For starters, the roof-top terrace they offer was pad-locked our entire stay. Also, the ""lobby bar"" is a small refrigerator and small stock of snack foods.

The hostel is in a great location, about a 15 minute walk to the houses of Parliament and the London eye. The hostel is situated in a housing area so it is really quiet at night but so close to all the action of London! The rooms were just like every other hostel. However each bed had a plug to charge their phone and a small bed light. The man at the reception was friendly also . Not the tidiest room I have stayed in but it was full and I was sharing with 15 other people. At the end of the day I was never in. London is the best city I have ever visited! Loved it!

Just a short walk from the Lambeth north subway station. A quiet residental area that looks like a quaint little neighbourhood.  The rooms were clean and comfortable enough to sleep, but there's no shelf to put your stuff and no curtain as the picture shows, at least not in my room.  There were 12 bunks in my room but only ever about 6 ppl there at once....I can't imagine how crowded 12 would have been.  There is no locker in the rooms but there's a luggage storage downstairs...however it's just a closet and everyone has access to it so it's not really private if you're worried about valuables.

Check in is at 4pm but there is a locked room you can keep your luggage in if you arrive in London early. It's a 15 minute walk from Lambeth North Station which is the second last station on the Bakerloo line but this line is not very long and has good connecting stations with the other main lines.  The staff were 50/50, some friendly some not, but not rude. There are two levels not including ground floor. There is a tight winding staircase which I nearly slipped down twice and is a bit annoying with heavy suitcases but we managed.

This is not one of the cheapest hostels in London, but I think it is worth the money. The location is nice, and not too far from a tube station. The beds were regular bunk beds in good conditions, and the staff was helpful. I didn't try their breakfast, but it is available and included in the price.  The only problem was that the toilet got blocked a few times, but the staff was quick to sort that out.  Overall, I was very satisfied. I would stay there again.",Date of stay: May 2012,4.0

There is a free breakfast in the hostel and it's adequate. There's also a fridge and microwave owen avaible.

They have about 10 rooms each with approximately 14 beds in it. When I went my friend and I were in the same room but our beds were very separate from each other. Cons: check in isn't until 4pm and isn't really flexible. Pros: ""breakfast"" is free (toast or cereal), free wifi or you can use their computers and pay about 2 euro/hour, you can leave your luggage there if you arrive before check in. Don't forget to bring your own towel and flip flops for the shower! Overall, I would stay there again if looking for a hostel situation, but I don't think I will again. Also, when I booked it seemed to add a LOT of ""taxes and fees"" at the end so it's not as great a deal as you originally think, may be able to find a hotel and have that added privacy‚Ä¶",Date of stay: September 2011,3.0
