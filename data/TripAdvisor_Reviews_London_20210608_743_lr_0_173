For the price I paid (£37) overall from the 3 days I stayed there I was quite happy with everything.   Checking in is swift, the staff are quite friendly and if you need any help just ask and they are more than happy to help. If you need to shower or intend on using one you can rent out a towel from the front desk for £2 (that’s if you’ve forgotten one or just didn’t pack one ) they also have drinks and snacks at the front desk for a decent price if you don’t want to leave the hostel to grab something little, there are also lockers there but you will need to buy your own lock (preferably one with a code) if you want to use one.   So the rooms... They’re actually pretty good ! The sheets were clean and I really liked the fact that the plug sockets had USB ports so I could charge other gadgets, the bed was pretty comfy for what I was paying and It’s similar to sleeping on a sofa. I bought my own sleeping liner because I wanted some protection just in case the sheets weren’t clean. The first night was a little restless because everyone including myself was getting used to the environment which is understandable. In my dormitory I had 7 other people and I just kept to myself and always made sure that my stuff out the way just to be respectful of others using the room, luckily I didn’t have any weirdos in the room and it was just fellow travellers ! So I was quite happy !   My only complaint about the rooms would be that they were a little cold in the evening, I don’t know if this was just a heating issue or just me but if you have yourself wrapped up and maybe throw on a hoodie you will be absolutely finest  Okay so breakfast it’s pretty simple (obviously) you have cereal, toast etc it’s quite basic but it’s free and I personally had zero complaints at the end of the day it’s a free meal if you really don’t like it you can go get yourself overpriced food from Central London but assuming you’re staying here because you’re on a budget wouldn’t make that much sense now would it ?  If you do want to make yourself meals throughout the day certainly can just make sure that you label stuff clearly and tidy up.   Free wifi is available but it tends to cut out every now and again which is annoying if you’re trying to do something.  The showers were tolerable they weren’t really that hot but It was warm enough to get yourself cleaned up and that’s all that mattered to me.  The nearest tube station is North Lambeth and it takes around 20 mins to get to most places alternatively you can walk but it’s gonna take you double the time. I must say though the location of this hostel being in Waterloo was really convenient as  everything was already on your doorstep   As far as this review goes there’s honestly not that much else to talk about but if you want to try a hostel or you’re looking to save some money then honestly this isn’t a bad choice at all ! I give it a thumbs up and I may consider returning in the future 👌🏼…",Date of stay: February 2020,4.0

Dark stains tell the tale of none or skimpy cleaning. Beds couldn't be any narrower, an obese person would NOT fit in, and there is no way of sitting up without bumping your head.  The kitchen consists of one 2-plate cooker and a microwave. Dishes tend to be dirty and/or full of suds. Breakfast consists of toast, margarine and jam.  Toilets are not very clean and the tiles in the showers are full of mould.  A thoroughly disgusting experience , hard to understand it has a licence to operate as a hostel.

Urgh! ,"I was in London for a week and decided to book a hostel in an attempt to save a bit of money. Lesson learned! You definitely get what you pay for and in the case of this place, you’ll get a whole lot more too - mostly bugs.   First of all, to be absolutely fair to them, the staff are really lovely. They’re helpful and super accommodating but that doesn’t disguise the fact that the place is a complete flea pit. I’ve stayed in hostels before, in various countries and at various price levels, so it wasn’t that my expectations were unrealistic. It genuinely is the case that this place is filthy. The layers of grime and dirt on the floors and woodwork was disgusting, especially in the kitchen. I couldn’t bring myself to use the shower (too gross) and the ‘continental breakfast’ is just a pile of bread next to a toaster with a sugar bowl full of cheap margarine and some plastic knives to spread it. Vile.   Booked for a week, stayed one night, gotten bitten to death by the disgusting bed bug type things that were crawling all over the room and then left the next morning. Seriously, I just never went back. Couldn’t bear the thought of putting my foot in the door again. I think I’d have been better off sleeping in the park! There are loads of hostels in London for a similar price where you’ll get a much more pleasant stay. I advise you to avoid this one and look elsewhere. …",Date of stay: November 2019,1.0

So much so, I chose not to finish my stay as I refused to stay in the conditions.  There was only one shower on each level, which were cramp and dirty. This was to be used by males and females, so there was no privacy.  It was super impractical as there were no lockers inside the room, only downstairs, so to keep going back and forth locking your belongings was difficult.  The rooms themselves were small and the bunks were loud and hard to manoeuvre.   All in all very disappointed in my stay and would not recommend to a friend.",Date of stay: October 2019,1.0

I've read many negative reviews about it, but gave it a try and was not disappointed. The beds were clean, comfy, I had my own private power socket and light. The bunk beds are a bit squeaky and I believe it may get a bit too crowd when it is fully occupied. The only con I can mention is their website say they offer lockers, but, unless you have your own lock, you'll have to buy one at the counter (or elsewhere), otherwise the locker is there, but there is no lock.

Breakfast is quite good, so as not to starve and you can eat and drink, oatmeal with milk and sandwiches with jam and butter, tea, coffee, without limitation . It is very quiet and quite decent noiseless Hostels, youth hostels residents (almost all young people).Staff gently disposes people (decent with decent ...).You can live in order to save, and with little luggage you could take with them each time leaving Hostels during the day.",Date of stay: August 2012,5.0

The hostel is in a great location, about a 15 minute walk to the houses of Parliament and the London eye. The hostel is situated in a housing area so it is really quiet at night but so close to all the action of London! The rooms were just like every other hostel. However each bed had a plug to charge their phone and a small bed light. The man at the reception was friendly also . Not the tidiest room I have stayed in but it was full and I was sharing with 15 other people. At the end of the day I was never in. London is the best city I have ever visited! Loved it! Would recommend this hostel and London in general without a doubt.",Date of stay: July 2012,4.0

For £180 Pounds a night I expected a bit more space.  Toilet was blocked a lot and had to queue.  Breakfast was paper plates and plastic spoons free for all (help yourself) tea and toast. The door codes were really annoying why not have swipe cards,needs some serious updating. Stayed in hostels before this was the worse.Very Very rough.",Date of stay: July 2012,1.0

Just a short walk from the Lambeth north subway station. A quiet residental area that looks like a quaint little neighbourhood.  The rooms were clean and comfortable enough to sleep, but there's no shelf to put your stuff and no curtain as the picture shows, at least not in my room.  There were 12 bunks in my room but only ever about 6 ppl there at once....I can't imagine how crowded 12 would have been.  There is no locker in the rooms but there's a luggage storage downstairs...however it's just a closet and everyone has access to it so it's not really private if you're worried about valuables. Honestly we just ended up leaving our bags…",Date of stay: July 2012,4.0

Check in is at 4pm but there is a locked room you can keep your luggage in if you arrive in London early. It's a 15 minute walk from Lambeth North Station which is the second last station on the Bakerloo line but this line is not very long and has good connecting stations with the other main lines.  The staff were 50/50, some friendly some not, but not rude. There are two levels not including ground floor. There is a tight winding staircase which I nearly slipped down twice and is a bit annoying with heavy suitcases but we managed. The room was 5 bunks that slept 3 each so it was a little cramped but everyone managed. The rooms were very hot and that was with both windows fully opened…",Date of stay: July 2012,5.0

A lot of close Boris bike stations and the Lambeth North on the Bakerloo line is less then 10 minutes away. Waterloo a bit further away.  The place is not among the cleanest or modern places. Free internet with weak signal reaching  the room at first floor where I was. The staff is not among the most trained or the most nice ever but at least never annoyed or annoying.     Beds comfortable board with personal light and socket was the must. The rest was essential. No lookers or luggage cages under the beds. Only tiny lookers £1 per day downstairs.   The narrow corridor-like kitchen has a 2seats breakfast table and a long board where cereal and similar are set in the morning and where people cue nicely. There are two huge fridges, better i do not tell you…",Date of stay: April 2012,2.0

This is not one of the cheapest hostels in London, but I think it is worth the money. The location is nice, and not too far from a tube station. The beds were regular bunk beds in good conditions, and the staff was helpful. I didn't try their breakfast, but it is available and included in the price.  The only problem was that the toilet got blocked a few times, but the staff was quick to sort that out.  Overall, I was very satisfied. I would stay there again.",Date of stay: May 2012,4.0

There are few rooms in a hostel. Each can entertain about 14 people, so it's quite crowded. There're no curtains at the beds. The room was quite clean, but it depends on people, who you share the room with. There are european and UK-type sockets avaible in each bed plus small lamp (but mine didn't work). There is a free breakfast in the hostel and it's adequate. There's also a fridge and microwave owen avaible. The localization of the hostel is very good, it's close to the underground station and in c.a. 4 minutes you are near the Thames (on foot). Wi-Fi is availble, but very slow.",Date of stay: May 2011,3.0

They have about 10 rooms each with approximately 14 beds in it. When I went my friend and I were in the same room but our beds were very separate from each other. Cons: check in isn't until 4pm and isn't really flexible. Pros: ""breakfast"" is free (toast or cereal), free wifi or you can use their computers and pay about 2 euro/hour, you can leave your luggage there if you arrive before check in. Don't forget to bring your own towel and flip flops for the shower! Overall, I would stay there again if looking for a hostel situation, but I don't think I will again. Also, when I booked it seemed to add a LOT of ""taxes and fees"" at the end so it's not as great a deal as you originally think, may be able to find a hotel and have that added privacy…",Date of stay: September 2011,3.0

The rooms are clean, and the beds are fairly comfy - if you are on the top bunk, but the bunks are triple bunks, and packed into quite small rooms. Ours was a 12 dorm room, that other hostels would normally put like 8 MAX. I couldn't get to my room when I arrived because there was a painter on the stairwell and he wouldn't move, told me I just had to wait, even though he could have easily moved for the few seconds it would take me to pass.  The showers on the second level are atrocious. They are barely a trickle of water that comes out and just a single push button that you have to keep pushing to get the trickle of water to stay on - Girls - very difficult to wash your hair!
