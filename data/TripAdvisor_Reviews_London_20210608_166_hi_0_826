Moved to another room whose sheets had holes in them.  Sales Director refused my suggestion of one night off in compensation (33%) - 'we don't discount Booking.com customers'.

Upon arrival to the hotel, there is no one to greet guests and the manager at reception pretends he is busy (even though 60% of the hotel is empty).   Then comes the rooms, toilet seats had stains, walls had dirt marks, carpet had stains, tissue box in bathroom comes apart when you try to draw a tissue, cheap fixings throughout about to come off, rooms are cold and heating system doesn’t work. One of the managers tried to convince me temperature was actually 24 degrees, I took a thermometer out and measured the temperate at 18 degrees. This maybe OK in summer, not in the winter. Also, duvets were very thin for winter months.  Then the service, I think they  tried to poison us in our meals when put unbelievable amounts of salt in the curry. The daytime manager (Hesham) can’t string two words together, and lacking English language/customer service skills. Another Basil Faulty in the making, who doesn’t want to address any issues and contradicts himself all the time. This hotel claims to be 4*, it is less than 1 based on my 2nights stay there.

The room was lovely but I discovered the new looking double shower (one normal shower and one large over head rain type shower head in the celling) was faulty and that you had to hold the shower head because the bracket on the wall had broken.
