I’ve stayed in plenty of premier inns, they’re always clean & tidy but for the price I paid I was expecting more. The Thyme restaurant felt especially tired & in need of a spruce up. The mattress was incredibly soft, didn’t make for a comfortable night’s sleep. A plug in electric oil filled radiator was an unexpected twist.   On the plus side the staff were friendly & efficient and the location is good for business or leisure.   £50 cheaper and I’d rate this as a good budget option but for £151 a night I won’t be back to this premier inn anytime soon.

My belief is that it went missing from our room during our stay but, since I didn't miss it until I got home I cannot say for certain.

The kids loved it, and their beds and bedding were fresh and clean (in other cheaper hotels the kids pull out beds have been musty presumably from irregular use) Staff were really helpful Location was amazing for monument, thames path, and the tower of London etc. Only thing I would change is the automated machines on reception, I think they leave the reception area looking impersonal and more budget. I presume they help to keep the cost down, but if not, trust your staff premier inn, they are good!!",Date of stay: October 2014,4.0

Excellent location.,I spent 2 nights at the Premier Inn. London is an expensive city to visit and the Premier Inn offered a clean and comfortable accommodation for a relatively affordable price. I booked a room on booking.com and apparently the only room left they had was a disabled accessible one. It was larger than their usual rooms so I cannot really comment on room size. The main asset of this hotel is definitely the location in the center of City of London. The London Bridge is at walking distance (5 minutes) so as the Central line station Bank. The staff were nice and helpful. There seems to be a possibility to self check in but the reception is manned 24/7 and we were helped by an actual person upon arrival.

We had requested a quiet room and the room on the second floor at the end of a corridor was exactly that.
