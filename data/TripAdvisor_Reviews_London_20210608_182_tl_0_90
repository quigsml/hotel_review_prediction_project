Receptionist couldn't have looked less bothered and wasn't pleasant. Even after showing them my confirmation email with reference number, I was still asked 'Are you sure you've got the right hotel?! Kept waiting 15 mins with two tired kids wasn't good. Finally gave me a key, went up to the toom, only to find it was already occupied. Back down to reception again and another wait for a room to be allocated. Finally in the room, which was very clean and bathroom had a great shower. Fan didn't work, so back down again for a replacement. Pillows were hard, but that's just preference. Checked out in the morning, with a different member of staff who was lovely.

Flooded bathroom,"Visited for a funeral in April 2021. Big car park, good covid safety measures. Comfortable beds although pillows a bit hard. Stayed two nights. unfortunately during the middle of the second night (at 02.30) I awoke to hear water trickling in the bathroom. got up and opened the door to discover a flood with bathroom floor under an inch of water. It was clean water that had backed up through the toilet. No phone in room so used mobile to call reception. Two staff appeared within 3-4 minutes. They reviewed situation and immediately offered another room. Took 5 minutes for them to identify another room on the same floor. We were moved within 15 minutes. It appears that the room next to ours had also had a plumbing problem earlier that day. Impressed with the staff- no fuss just dealt with the problem. Due to covid there was no food available but I would stay there again if needs be. The receptionist next day did suggest that we would be offered some compensation, probably a free stay at some point. Still waiting to hear about this a month on which is a shame as everything else was handled really well.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2021,4.0
