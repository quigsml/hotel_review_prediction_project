The building work outside started really early and looked like Steptoes back yard from our window.  If you want parking opt for early checkin which is an extra £10 when you book. There are limited spaces, if you do arrive late you can park in halfords parking bays as long as you've left by 9ish.  You definitely get what you pay..... We won't be staying here again.

Going back to the design aspect - Travelodge you should've sacked you architect as a 5 yr old could design it better!
