My agency had previously booked me in to the Ibis in Docklands (at least half hour train/tube journey ... when the trains are running, which they werent!)  They thought I would prefer somewhere more comfortable.   And yes Whitechapel does not have the interesting surroundings of the docks but all I need is a comfy bed, hot water and wifi.  All of which I had in abundance in here.   The staff are amazing.  My agency had completely messed up my booking, so i arrived late at night ti having to organise a room.  Jessica was fantastic, and helped me sort it all out. I miss having drink facilities in the room, but complimentary tea and coffee is available day and night from the cafe area.   I didnt try the food as I am not a breakfast person but it all appeared to be very well -organised. The room was clean and warm.  A lack of toiletries is not an issue for me as I prefer my own.  The only slight niggle was that there was no plug socket near the mirrors for my hairdryer.  I will definitely be staying here again.…",Date of stay: February 2020,4.0

Everything met my expectations except for a few things. 1 - no face cloths...2 - No latch or lock of any sort on the toilet door... 3 - The shower is in the middle of the bedroom with a clear glass door... so there is zero privacy.  Otherwise it is a very decent budget hotel... although I should note that the area isn't the nicest and I would not feel safe at night on my own in this part of town. I would probably not stay here again simply for that reason.  FYI Whitechapel tube station is 5 to 10 minute walk. Bus is right at the front door.,Date of stay: March 2015,3.0

Good location.,"I stayed at the Ibis Budget Whitechapel with my parents during the summer, while travelling in the UK. It was ok, but not quite what we were expecting. We booked a triple room for three adults, which was a double bed and bunk bed over the double bed. The room was cramped but that is central London for you. It had enough power points and was very clean.   What threw us was that the shower door opened directly - and I do mean directly - into the room, meaning absolutely no privacy for anyone. There is no way we would have booked if we had realised this in advance. No bath mats provided. We all had to take turns waiting out in the corridor while someone showered, which seems pretty poor design. In that respect alone I would not stay again as part of a family group.

My first recommendation would be to book directly with the hotel because Bookings dot com takes a whopping bite of the room charge so no breakfast unless you add 9 pounds per guest, instead book directly and breakfast is included.

Everything was top-notch. The room, given the tariff, was way above our expectations - en suite facilities! Although there wasn't a restaurant (we didn't require one) the breakfast area was perfectly suitable and the fare was excellent. Location was very good - about 10 minutes, by bus, to St Paul's  and there was a tube station very close - very central.",Date of stay: August 2012,5.0

It is right next to a Mosque.  It was a little weird toting luggage from the white chapel tube station with many people looking at us like we surely didn't belong there.  The staff was very friendly, a little difficult and times to communicate, most were from Russia.  Rooms are clean and comfortable and VERY basic.  Breakfast was reasonable and great for our kids.

As we were visiting the Olympics, the hotel was ideally located between the city center and the Olympic Park. 2 subway stations are within walking distance. The rooms are clean and brand new but small and with basic comfort; friendly service at the reception desk. Very good price/ quality ratio.

Compared to some of the budget places I've stayed at near Paddington, this is head and shoulders above them.  I happened upon a post about a new Ibis hotel opening in Whitechapel and the rate was fantastic, 44£ for the 1st nights and 60£ for the other 4 nights. The hotel is brand new, they seem to have built the entrance inside a former car showroom and then up.  I reserved a double room as it was the same price as a twin. When I arrived very early in the morning from Heathrow, they first said it would be an extra 10£ to check in early and then said, sorrry, we were fully booked last night and that's not an option.  I think the area around the hotel is interesting with a lot of ethnic…",Date of stay: July 2012,4.0

It is predominantly a Muslim locality. The rooms are very small, with no space to move around at all. However, the staff is very helpful. The room was very clean and the linen etc were also clean. There is another Ibis hotel very close by and hence you are likely to be misguided, if you ask for directions. People would probably guide you in the direction of the other Ibis. And especially, if you have decided to walk to the hotel from the station with your luggage - the ""misguided"" directions could be tiring (since the other Ibis is exactly in the opposite direction!)",Date of stay: July 2012,3.0

Very close to 2 tube stations which you could use to get anywhere in the city. 5min walk to brick lane for some amazing food. Black cab cost 18quid from soho back to the hotel. The night bus also ran from the centre to the hotel very often and was very cheap. Hotel itself was very clean, showers are fab. the room itself (we had 2 x triple rooms) were a little small but we only wanted the room for sleeping so not really an issue. The only issues we had was that it was sooooo hot in the rooms despite the A/C being on constantly! and we had 3 in each room but there were only 2 towels in each room so we had to ask for more…",Date of stay: July 2012,4.0
