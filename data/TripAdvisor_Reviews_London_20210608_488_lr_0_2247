It was bulky placed rather awkwardly with a huge flexible hose attached to the wall. Towels provided are TINY, and the breakfast was ‘sad’. We stayed there 3 nights and only took it on the first day.

On the negative side, the property was a maze of long and winding corridors and staircases, punctuated by multiple fire doors. Despite its somewhat grand exterior, the interior was almost prison like. Contributing to this oppressive atmosphere were multiple unnecessary warning notices threatening fines of up to £500 for “crimes” such as using an emergency exit, setting off a fire alarm or flooding a bathroom.

The kitchen was not well equipped - no toaster, a tempremental dishwasher etc. The biggest problem though was that the hot water ran out quite early in the morning and we often ended up with cold showers, not at all pleasant in winter.
