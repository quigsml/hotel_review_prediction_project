It was good but there were some gaps.  It was no better than a Premier Inn. The bedrooms are not well sound proofed.  In the room I was first offered I could hear the people next door very clearly.  When I mentioned this I was immediately offered a different room with no fuss. My bedroom was comfortable and exceptionally clean.  As other people have said you cannot open the window.  There was no sink plug in the bathroom, the shower head was not properly connected so that water sprayed over the floor, and there were no tumblers or other drinking glasses. The breakfast was ok, if a bit limited.  The food included boiled eggs, but there were no egg cups or spoons to eat them with.  I am used to doing without these things abroad but they are usual in England.  I would also have preferred to eat breakfast without a television blaring away. The staff were exceptionally pleasant and attentive.  I did not mention the egg cups or the television, but they dealt with everything I asked for.…",Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

And very kind with my 5 year old. The room was a good size for London and we had a good nights sleep. The breakfast is varied enough. Good coffee. Loved that there was also a coffee machine in the room. I think a couple of the reviews I have seen are unfair/ overly fussy as price v quality for London this is really a great and friendly small hotel. I would have no hesitation about recommending or staying here again. We loved it. ,Date of stay: February 2020,5.0

The booking in went okay but the smell of the room when we opened the door was over whelming - its fresh air that was needed NOT air conditioning OPEN the WINDOWS and let it in. We would have done it ourselves but the window would not open  It was obvious that the room had not been used for some time a sad draw back of Covid-19.  The room had a King size bed and a TV that needs urgent retuning or better still install a new tv they are as cheap as chips nowadays.  The bathroom was clean: just; more than we can say about the wall tiles. which either need a good clean or replacing.   The water pipe connected to the shower was letting out nearly as much water as the awful shower itself, if we had not moved the curtain fully round and held it in position we and the King size bed would be floating down Cromwell road. Yikes.  We have stayed at many Accor hotels but this was by far the poorest of them all which is sad as we enjoy staying in their hotels. Even the bathrobes had different named hotels on them.  A full refurbishment is required here if this hotel is to compete with the new Premier Inn and Travelodge super rooms which leaves this hotel amenities well behind and this room was supposed to be a Kings privilege room.  We don't pass comment on sleep quality as you either have a good nights sleep or you don't can't blame the hotel for that.  However, on the plus side its close to the museums and parks and is in a good location with nice staff. Shame about the accommodation.…",Date of stay: May 2021,2.0

The next day, I realised I had been badly bitten by bed bugs as I had red itchy bumps all over my legs and arms and elsewhere. Disgusting. The room was obviously not cleaned properly as there was a bad musty smell and the bed bugs was a clear indication of poor cleaning. The door wouldn't lock properly either as I could just push it open when I entered the room.   Like the previous reviewer mentioned, there is a £50 deposit charged to your debit/ credit card to cover any damage you may do to the room which I was told would be pending until I checked out and refunded once the room is checked, but the charge had gone through on my bank account, not pending as advised. I had to call Acor hotel group customer services to complain about this and the bed bugs to make sure this deposit was refunded.   They refused to give me the name of the hotels manager for some weird reason, even though I've just discovered her name is clearly seen on her responses to other TA reviews.  So why not just give me her name? They obviously don't care and are just desperate to take any money they can during these testing times.…",Date of stay: May 2021,1.0

It's cramped, shabby, noisy and the food isn't great.  Despite the covid regulations, I didn't see another member of staff or guest wearing a mask but I did notice a rather sleazy chap getting far too close to the reception staff. Speaking of the receptionist, she was the one bright light in this otherwise gloomy establishment. Sorry I can't remember her name. The price / quality of the breakfast has been mentioned in other reviews and I can only confirm that it's as bad as they say. Save yourself a few quid and go to a coffee shop nearby instead.

Apart from that they handed me a brown bag with an apple and a croissant for breakfast, which was 14.00 per day extra! When I booked I was assuming that the restaurant was open and they didn't say it was a takeaway! Of course you've got to take economy into a/c on this one as they were cheaper than most and also offer 20% discount if you return!

Short walk to Gloucester Rd tube, big Sainsburys open all hours almost next door and plenty of restaurants in walking distance.  The hotel was very clean and the staff very pleasant.

But these are minor things which did not detract from our enjoyable stay.

Having tried many other London hotels, the Mercure has definitely become our London hotel of choice. The location is partway between the Earl's Court and Gloucester Road underground stations - a little closer to Earl's Court. It is easy to get the tube from Heathrow Airport to Earl's Court, where you can exit without having to use stairs if you have luggage. Then it is just a 5 minute walk to the Mercure. There is a supermarket a couple of minutes walk away and plenty of eating options around the Earl's Court and Gloucester Road underground stations. The rooms vary, depending what you have booked. The small doubles are indeed very small, and we do not book them anymore as there is just no room for suitcases. In…",Date of stay: September 2019,4.0

(4 days) I found this at least annoying. When asked the reception said that this policy has been adopted since some other person gave them false visa details and then left the hotel. I found the excuse ridiculous but I had to pay in advance since I had nowhere else to go at 19:00 in an unknown city. Contemporary rooms are ok in size but windows won't open. The room had a wooden door communicating with the adjacent room. YES WE COULD HEAR EVERYTHING. Breakfast is ok. Beds are very uncomfortable, mattresses must be very old.",Date of stay: October 2010,1.0

I have stayed in youth hostels that were far better. The double room was so small that we could not walk around the bed with our luggage there. I could hear the man in the next room snoring and when he turned his television on at 7 in the morning I got a full run down of the days news. We were then woken again at 8 when the cleaner knocked on the door to see if she could clean it. We were not informed that breakfast was included so we missed it. It is false advertising at best, robbery would be more accurate. It was  the worst place I have stayed at in the 40 countries I have been to. It would have been fine for a 2 star hotel at a fraction of the price.",Date of stay: October 2010,1.0

The room was not very big but we had enough space for our luggage and it was very clean. We had a few problems using the wireless Internet and the staff did not know how to help us but we finally were able to use it. The location is the best part of this hotel, as it is close to two Underground stations and several restaurants and services. The lows are that there was no ventilation at all in the room and the bathroom, and the windows could not open; and that sometimes we could hear the people in rooms over and around us talking or taking showers; but none of this influenced our good night of sleep. Overall it is an hotel with great facilities situated in a very good location for sightseeing around the city and we would return…",Date of stay: September 2010,4.0

There is no restaurant, no room service, the receptionist is always alone, and the rooms are very small, windows cannot open, and the noise from the communicating doors make for a terrible night's sleep. Best avoided! They charge 4 star rates though. Do not stay here. The Premier across the road has larger beds, better rooms, at around half the price.",Date of stay: September 2010,1.0
