We normally stop at the Premier Inn opposite St Pancras, the Kings Cross hotel proved to be cheaper and marginally more convenient with regards location, they're 10 minutes walk from each other. Location is perfect, a few mins walk to Kings Cross train and tube. Our experience with the staff has always been very positive and this hotel is no different. We rang in advance to discuss the reasons for travel and they were very helpful. Check-in was seamless and the people were very friendly. At the time a Premier Plus room was only marginally more expensive so that's what we booked. Overall it had some nice touches but for us a standard room would have sufficed. Whilst the TV worked the smart functions such as a guide and many of the channels didn't work. For us the hotel was a base so this wasn't essential, I'm sure the staff would have resolved it if it we'd raised it. There's a little more on offer with this Premier Inn in that there's a restaurant and a Costa off of a central atrium. It's a good looking modern hotel. As someone who regularly used to book and stay in London hotels I believe the value is unsurpassed. I certainly couldn't find anything cheaper that offers the same amenities and is so close to travel hubs.…",Date of stay: December 2020,5.0

I have tried to rate this review based on the price we have paid- significantly less than usual London prices however we still paid enough to expect some basics to be in place... here goes!  On arrival, the system was down so there was a long wait to check in. Plenty of others were also waiting and there was not much in the way of apology from the staff. When we finally received our key, there was only one lift working so again a big queue! The room (premier plus) was as expected from Premier Inn which some added extras- the fridge was great to have and it was nice to have water and some little chocolates. However- there was only one towel set, very little loo roll and the shower gel (upgraded ones) was low and had been topped up with water to eek it out!! Not impressed as there was no maid service to top it up (as we expected from our last COVID stay in a different Premier Inn) and when we asked for more, the reception staff either were too busy to sort it, couldn’t find the ‘premier plus’ stock or forgot to bring the things we needed! We therefore didn’t have any replacement coffee pods, chocolates or shower gel. We had to ask on both days for more milk and water and this took over half an hour to reach us on both days.  Then to top it off, on our day, we were awoken by the maid at 8am to clean the room! We’d not seen one for 3 days and then we were greeted early on our last day- felt a bit like salt in the wound and not appreciated when check out was midday! When we did check out, we were asked about our stay. We said it was ‘so-so’ and the receptionist just shrugged her shoulders and didn’t really care. To be honest, I think she was probably used to hearing it as plenty of others were also moaning and feeling the same.  To summarise, I’m sure this hotel would be fine in usual times - it’s a great location and the fridge was great in the room. However at the minute, the way that they are organising refills of services (especially refreshments for the premier plus rooms) is not good enough. Staff are stretched but simple things like a made up bag of bits would be useful so that asking didn’t seem like a chore for the staff (that’s how we felt). We are big fans of Premier Inn so it is a shame to write this however we don’t want others to felt the way we did over our latest stay. Sent from my iPhone…",Date of stay: May 2021,2.0

This time the stay was awful - paid for a premier plus room which was smaller than their standard rooms. There was just one foot of space down one side of the bed. The first two Nespresso machines in the room both flooded the tray they were on. We asked for toast for breakfast but were given a pile of bread and told 'toaster broken'. After complaining we were then given some toast which  when buttered and spread with jam, tasted of bacon fat.

Shame about the rude staff. Room was very hot and rising and not able to turn down air con. After going downstairs and asking for it to be turned down it was another 45 minutes before a rude manager (again bald with glasses) came up with a very bad attitude insisting you’ve never been able to adjust the temperature which is a complete lie.  I’ve stayed in this very hotel on more than 30 occasions for business and have turned it down EVERY single time.   Speaking to colleagues after they confirmed the same.   Please make your rooms either cooler or change back to letting adults be adults and adjust their own room temperature.

As a treat we had booked ourselves into an 5 Star hotel in London for a few days, after our return from Scotland, over New Year.  Within 30 minutes of arriving at the 5 Star hotel, we all wished that we had rather booked into the Premier Inn.  Premier Inn is conveniently located close to the overground train station and the Tube, with all the necessary shops (and a nice M&S at the station) and a choice of restaurants and coffee shops.  The hotel itself has a very nice restaurant where we were served a fantastic breakfast.

Only negatives were that the free WiFi was basically unusably slow (could barely handle a tweet) so you basically have to pay for the premium offering. Another £5 per day.  Also the kitchen shuts early given the location (10:00 - and chances are you’re getting off an evening train into London) so if you get off a late evening train you’ll probably find yourself heading back out for food.

While waiting for the cab to arrive, my husband was anxious as he was afraid to be late for the plane after 10minutes of waiting.

We booked it because it's near St Pancras for the Eurostar, wanted something we knew would be OK, and found a real gem of a hotel.

You have to call the front desk each day if you want 2 hand-towels. 2. We upgraded on 2 evenings, adding evening meal to our stay. This was priced accordingly at a reduced rate.

Whilst we waited the man was very friendly, asking us what we would be doing and giving us lots of advice. To put it simply, the rooms were incredible.

Only problem or concern, is that getting into the shower can be a bit difficult as the walls to the tub are extremely high.  I also felt that the lighting in our room could have been better.

The noise, the shouting, and the general disturbance seemed to go on into the early hours of the next morning. It was warm weather and so many of the customers were on the pavement drinking.

Reception was friendly and efficient. Our twin room was fairly spacious, spotlessly clean, with comfortable beds; and for central London relatively modestly priced at £145 for a one night stay.

It was the most expensive Premier Inn we had stayed in by far and yet it had the smallest room of the 5 Premier Inns we stayed in across the UK during our trip.  We asked for a family room for 4 and I thought it was a bit rich to have to pay 169 pounds a night and have a mattress on the floor as the fourth bed.  We were on the 1st floor and copped a bit of steet noise.  Have to say, (and this is not the fault of the hotel) but the Kings Cross area is not the nicest area to stay in.

If I had one small quibble, it is the Premier Inn's tendency to instal Lux liquid soap containers above the bath. Yes, they can serve as soap, shampoo and body gel, all rolled into one.

My husband and I went to London for a long weekend and we desired an affordable, clean room with a comfortable bed, great location with good access to the tube and a good English breakfast.  This hotel was excellent on all these points.    As others have said in previous reviews, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was cleaned & sheets changed every day.  I don't know what the complaints about the breakfast were about, since we had nothing but delicious and plentiful food each morning and smiling service from the staff.

Standard budget fare inside. Horrible smell of cigarrette smoke in corridors, but the room was clean and the bed comfortable. A little noisy, despite the double-glazing.  Its problem is that rates keep creeping up. At £85 per night, this is getting to be close to the price that the decent hotels nearby charge when they're on special offer (e.g. Novotel London Euston, just along the road). It's hardly a ""budget"" price for a very basic experience. ",Date of stay: August 2006,3.0

And it gets worse every time.   At first it was a nice hotel. Friendly staff, nice interior etc. The time before this last visit, the bottom of the bed was ripped and in a right state. This time, what topped it for us was at 9.20 in the morning, whilst we were still in bed as we didn't check out until midday, the chambermaid was trying to get into the room. She was banging on the door, even trying to put her keycard in while shouting ""hello hello let me in"" and we had to should ""2 minutes please"" !!

The hotel apperently is only 6 months old so eveything is clean and tidy, the staff , bar, reception and maids were all VERY polite and proffesional.  What also makes this a good location is that the St Pancas/Kings Cross Tube Station has a lot of lines going through it, ( a very busy intersection ) so wherever you are going or coming back from,  you can do it with a minimum of transfers.

Was very unsure of the area to book for the hotel, and after reading the reviews on this hotel, we decided to give it a whirl.  The whole 3 nights stay including train travel was £315 - good price, with the kids going free.  When we got to Kings Cross, the hotel was simply across the road, and easy to find with the name banners.  The lobby was very bright and clean, and even though we could not check in as we were early, they kept our luggage in a safe room while we went to see the sights.

I was visiting with my parents and stayed at the PTI in Edinburgh as well.  PTIs seem to be very consistent in quality and product.  Location is very good, right across the street from Kings Cross tube and train station.  Lots of restaurants and shops close by.  There is some construction across the street, so it can be a little bit noisy at times.  Check-in was fast and courteous.  The room was quite spacious, with a king bed, table and two armchairs, desk, wall mirrors, hair dryer, tv, and wireless Internet.

Desk personnel were very friendly and the room was excellent.  This was the end of our time in Europe and the bed was the most comfortable of any.  I am told that for London, 85 Euros for Thursday night and 75 Euros for Friday night (VAT included) was an excellent value.  The room was spotless as was the bathroom.  The TV had 4 radio channels and about ten TV channels.   Security was excellent.  Anyone can access the elevators, but one must have a room key to pass through the doors that give you access to the rooms.
