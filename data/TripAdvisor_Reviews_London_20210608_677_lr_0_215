However we arrived to find a sign saying to check in at another hotel about a five minute walk away.   The check in window reminded me of a less than reputable place somewhere in the third world.    Apparently this hotel 'chain' called Saba owns at least six to eight different 'hotels' on this street, and if you book one they just put you interchangeably in any of them.  Which gives you the bit the feeling of being cattle that can be just moved from here to there.  They sent us to yet another hotel a few doors down.  A room in the basement that was little more than the size of the bed itself.   The bad part was a smell of mold or mildew.    My wife wasn't having this so we headed back to reception.  Fortunately they had a better room on the half-landing in yet another building.     This room was actually clean and the bathroom, recently renovated made a decent impression.  (Nevertheless we cleaned all the surfaces in the room with disinfectant wipes due to the ongoing pandemic.)  The room featured a fridge which was a nice touch that you don't find so often in the UK.      In the morning we were offered breakfast which consisted of scrambled eggs, toast,  coffee, tea and cereals, which was good enough to get us started.     The breakfast was a surprise because, of two other hotels I've stayed at recently in London, two of them have stopped serving breakfast altogether due to the pandemic, and another only serves a takeaway snack box.  The best thing about this location is that just outside the door are a number of unexpectedly excellent eating options.    Try Gails fresh pastries for breakfast,  or the Acropolis for a tasty greek gyros, or Farina and More for good Italian food.   (and quite a few others nice places nearby as well).    Given the choice I would probably not stay here again, except in a pinch.  But it may be worth a look if you can get it for a low rate.…",Date of stay: September 2020,3.0

The check-in process was ok, allthough we arrived late in the evening. The room was very small (typical for London) and so was the bathroom. The central heat was not working, but upon arriving in the room I found an electric heater which helped me stay warm. The TV did not work, but I did not need it so I didn't say anything. I was on the 2nd floor and the water pressure was quite low. My biggest issue was the fact that the room was noisy because of the proximity to the main street. Unfortunately the windows looked quite old and did not isolate the noise. Also the bed was right next to the window and during the night it got a bit cold. Breakfast was served daily from 7.30 AM and was allright. Not too many choices but the food was good, and that's really important! I choose the hotel because of the location (it was within walking distance to where I had to be daily) and also within walking distance to the Piccadilly Metro Line, so that worked out just fine. All in all, I probably would not stay there again, allthough some things were ok.…",Date of stay: February 2020,3.0

Its not the Ritz but for what you pay for its ratings it was really nice. Clean and all freshly painted. Rooms are small, we had 3 in a triple room. One single and one double. Has a standard fridge to cool your drinks! Tea & coffee facilities great. Free Wi-Fi and TV. USB charging points in room a bonus as I forgot my plug. Hairdryer as well. Bathroom is small, but shower is large enough. As long as you don't bring lots or large luggage you'll be fine! There is no lift and stairs are steep, so not ideal for some. Breakfast although next door was more than adequate. Freshly cooked eggs to your liking, beans, cereal, cheeses, yogurts etc. Ideal location for olympia about a 10 minute walk and probably 15 minute from nearest tube.

Looks recently redecorated with new carpets etc. Everywhere clean. Good shower, comfortable mattress, good amount of teas & coffees in room and a fridge which is rare in a room for this price.

We were given a room that was up five flights of stairs in what used to be the attic. The room was clean, the bathroom was modern and breakfast was nice.  However, the logistics of the room gave the impression that it had been thrown together in a hurry to accommodate a twin room. The only mirror in the bedroom was half covered by the wardrobe and placed behind the bed, and the bedside lights were on the adjacent wall, nowhere near the beds. There was a tv but no remote, and with a busy road outside it is a very, very, noisy room.

The owner - who remembered me from last time - greeted us warmly and allocated us a twin room in the basement. It was recently refurbished and spotless. Small bathroom with a decent shower, tv and tea and coffee making facilities. The twin beds were comfy. The only downside was that the room was next door to the breakfast kitchen so we were woken early by the staff arriving and working in the kitchen - no big deal really.

We booked online, there was only one staff sorting out the bookings and not very welcoming. The hotel, like other rows of hotels in the area is a converted row of old houses. We were given a two single bedroom on the top floor. It was clean and eventhough it was quiet, it feels very old and needed an upgrade to say the least. We had a plated breakfast which was good, the breakfast area tebds to be busy with limited room to accomodate so having breakfast feels like a race.
