Depsite being on the ground floor, their was little to no noise from outside. The room was comfortable and had everything you would expect, it's clearly a well used hotel as parts of the decor are worn but it's not really an issue.  The location is great as it's less than 2 minutes walk from Earls Court underground station to get into Central London.  The free WiFi was amazing and really quick, I had 2 video conference calls using the wifi and had a great signal throughout (can't say the same for some other hotel brands).

They were very loud, woke us up at 1 am and kept being loud for two hours. The phone in the room to call the reception is not plugged in and no where to plug in so we could not call to complain. We tried the phone on the website but nobody answered. The beds are not good and very hard. The bathroom sink is also very small with a high tab which results in water splashing everywhere when you use it and there came no hand towel with the room to dry off. One time we left the sign on the front door saying they could come in and clean and we came back and nothing had been done.

I complained through the Accor website and received a reply from the hotel manager which seemed to agree with me but used the excuse that since the hotel is new, the photograph is not of an actual room.

It is in a great part of town, especially if you are visiting an exhibition as I was either at Earls Court or Olympia. It is only a few minutes walk from Earls Court tube station with good links to the centre of London, but bear in mind that the loop that takes you to Olympia is only open at weekends or special events days - it's worth checking before hand.

The free breakfast was okay. It would be nice if there was an option to pay for a cooked breakfast but there wasn't.
