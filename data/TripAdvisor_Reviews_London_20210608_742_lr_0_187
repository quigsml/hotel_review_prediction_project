Here’s a list of everything wrong with this place!  Tiny bathroom (literally couldn’t turn around) Dim light with broken light cover No soap No handtowels No bathroom bin Wallpaper and plaster falling down Breakfast was warm bread and coffee served on a dirty table from the other guests.  And live electric wires out the wall!  Asked to speak to the manager where I was told he’d be there in 10 minutes. An hour later he turned up, was rude, disrespectful and didn’t care about our complaints.   PLEASE DONT STAY HERE!!  For £258 it was a horrific experience and a complete waste of money.

The location is spot on, few minutes walk to both Victoria Coach station and Victoria Station, not just for rail services but for underground services too. You can walk to attractions like Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the London Eye in around 20 minutes.  The hotel itself is in need of a refub but saying that it was clean and tidy. Check in was swift and the staff we encounted were happy and helpful. As we chose this hotel purely on location we opted for the the double room with a shared bathroom. There was no bath but a walk in shower, hand basin and toilet. They kept this very clean but I do feel that the hotel needs to fit a shower screen as all they had up was a shower curtain. As you can imagine the floor got very wet and this could cause someone to slip and fall causing injury. The room itself was clean and came with tea/coffee, kettle and digital TV. The breakfast was continental so this consisted of toast, cereal a yoghurt. I would definitely stay here again if we came to London again. …",Date of stay: November 2019,3.0

Well, we did not expect 5 stars, of course. No lift, which can be difficult if you have heavy luggage. The front reception on the day we arrived was super friendly. We stayed a total of 3 nights. Only took breakfast on one of those days, not really worth it for us, but it´s something, although the lady serving us, which I also think was the cleaning lady, was not friendly at all (however, if she was pretty much the only staff not at reception, I kind of don´t blame her). I personally had the very unfortunate incident of being bitten by bedbugs. I don´t know why I did not complain initially, but I didn´t think it would be so bad, but over one month later, I am still scratching the scars on my arms and neck. I don´t want to completely be negative about this place, but it was not a pleasant experience. The room we got was a decent size, two separate beds (my mum had a double bed, which was very springy, and she was not infested with bed bugs, luckily). Mine was a single bed, and it was comfortable enough, except for the dreaded bed bugs. Sadly, I cannot really recommend this place highly, but if you´re aware of the possible infestation but need a cheap place in a good location, considerate it, but not lightly. Some people had better experiences, others even worse than mine. I am trying to be as transparent as possible. I hope my review helps.…",Date of stay: October 2019,2.0

We arrived on Monday 14th after a long flight and the hotel manager, Bhaven Patel, advised my partner and I that our room had also been booked by another couple. Now before we could say do anything he had already been on the phone to the comparison site and immediately jumped onto the phone to hotels nearby to find us new accommodation. Within 10 minutes we were in a new hotel just 3 minutes down the road and he even covered the additional costs.
