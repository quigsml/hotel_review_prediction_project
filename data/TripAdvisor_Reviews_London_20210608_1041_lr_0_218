Received numerous confirmation emails from OYO incluidng one on day of my arrival.  When I turned up at the hotel - IT WAS CLOSED!!!   No sign of life.  Rang the help line.  No answer.  Had to book alternative hotel room.  OYO then rang me back and apologised offering another location.  The hotel was clearly shut for some time.  The OYO representative did not even attempt to claim otherwise.  I guess this is some kind of scam?  Maybe they take the booking and always intend to move you to another hotel when you turn up, knowing this one is shut - so allowing them to save money from shutting premises but still taking bookings and sendiing out confirmation emails.  Astounding!  That was booking.com by the way who must share some responsibility for effectivley tricking their customers.…",Date of stay: June 2021,1.0

They said they would relocate us to a nearby hotel under the same franchise. After over an hour waiting, they said this was not possible as they couldn't find the other hotels from their franchise on their system. Even though the hotel down the road was advertising vacancies and the manager there was more than happy to accommodate us. The manager of this hotel within the same franchise also spoke to the customer support and was less than impressed. To make matters worse the hotel refused to give us a refund.

AVOID!,"After booking this hotel for my boyfriends 21st birthday present a few months in advance, I was left extremely angry and in a panic. After messaging the property two days in advance to check it was still open due to COVID-19 and was told that if there was any change that I would be contacted. We travelled on the train to London at 4pm (check-in was 3pm) it wasn’t until 5pm when the property contacted me to tell me that that had cancelled due to ‘unforeseen circumstances’ This lead to me nearly having a panic attack on the train due to stress. When I had requested to be put in another nearby hotel of the same branch I was informed that this was not possible (even though after this conversation I had checked and other hotels were advertising availability as was this one) I had to book a last minute, more expensive, hotel as they provided no aid in finding another place. Basically leaving me stranded in London until I was able to find a hotel with availability. I’m extremely angry and upset with this hotel and have never experienced anything like this ever. I have received no compensation for the utterly appalling way this booking was dealt with and I urge everyone to stay away from this hotel for your own sanity.…",Date of stay: September 2020,1.0
