I received a warm welcome from Alex at check-in who kindly upgraded me as a Gold Hilton Honors Member.  The recent renovation to the rooms (including Digital Key), quality of the furnishings and professionalism of the staff made it one of the best Hilton hotels I've stayed at around the world. There is a clear focus on a COVID-secure environment whilst ensuring that guests can benefit from full amenities including a well-equipped spacious gym and delicious hot cooked breakfast. The DoubleTree by Hilton London Angel Kings Cross is excellent value for money when considering quality, amenities and location in Central London with close proximity to both Angel Underground Station (Northern Line) and London Kings Cross St Pancras train station.  Special thanks also go to George who consistently went above and beyond at an extremely busy breakfast service.  I look forward to future stays in 2021!…",Date of stay: December 2020,5.0

The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from Euston and 10 minute walk from King’s Cross/St. Pancras and there are shops nearby that are very convenient for buying anything that was requiring while travelling.  I was welcomed enthusiastically by the Reception Team and was informed that the bar and restaurant had opened for inside dining. A warm signature DoubleTree cookie was offered.   Two bottles of water were offered; otherwise, my Hilton Honors Diamond status was not explicitly acknowledged at all. I was not offered a room upgrade nor was any explanation given as to why this was so (a check on the Hilton app showed that there were potentially possible upgrades). I had to enquire about breakfast (a full breakfast is offered to Diamond members) and the Executive Lounge (currently closed with no alternative offerings to guests with Executive Lounge access but it is hoped that it will be open in September 2021) instead of being informed at check in.   The Queen Guest room I got was at the back of the building which suited me as I prefer a quieter area. The size of the room was good for London. The bathroom was adequate with a shower of decent pressure; the usual Crabtree & Evelyn products were offered. I had a generally comfortable night. The air conditioning seemed a bit temperamental; temperature settings would change by itself and it switched itself off after a couple of hours. While this did not bother me as the ambient temperature was comfortable, I imagine that this would be an issue if one was staying at the height of summer.  Breakfast was served in the restaurant. There was a continental buffet as well as the usual hot components of a Full English that was plated by a serving chef.   All in all, an adequate stay.…",Date of stay: April 2021,3.0

I have a few reliable old favourites that I return to time and time again but sometimes prices jump up for no apparent reason so I have to look elsewhere. And so it was that I found myself spending the night at this branch of the Doubletree chain the other night. A few years ago there were few if any Doubletrees in the city but since then they seem to have sprung up all over the place. This one is bigger and brasher than most and - unlike some of their other branches - comes with a gym and an executive lounge. It is on a very busy road so I carefully selected a room around the back when checking in online. This meant I had a quiet and restful night.

Rooms are clean, comfortable and of a fair size given the hotel's central location and staff are extremely helpful.
