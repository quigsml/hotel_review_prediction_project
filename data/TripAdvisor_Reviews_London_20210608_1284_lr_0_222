I arrived on a Monday at around 21.30 after having been stood around for around 5mins someone finally decided to acknowledge my existence and come over in check me in. Id made eye contact a few times with a waiter floating around but he had just ignored me. A gentlemen continues to check me in he then askes me for a DRIVING LICENSE or PASSPORT. I had neither on me as i was only visiting friends for a few days and would not need either, being in the British military i always carry  this ID, which clearly states my name, DOB photo i mean it even has my height on there. He told me he could not accept this, as you can imagine i was clearly distraught by this! I begged him to accept it as it doesn’t get much more official then ID from the Queen herself! I explained to him i didn’t even have charge on my phone at this point, so would struggle to find somewhere to stay. This guy did not care he just kept saying sorry and watched me in my distressed state leave the building.   Ive since accessed the booking information for this company and it states the following:   Please note that a valid passport, photo ID, or driver’s license is required upon check-in.  Now excuse me if I'm mistaken but is a Military ID not photo ID as it states in there booking information?. Ive never been treated so badly from a hostel in my entire experience of staying in such accomadation. …",Date of stay: September 2020,1.0

The bathroom and showers were shared by the floor was kinda below average to my expectations.  I disagree with a previous review stating that this was close to the tube station as I found it was a quite a walk and took some time to locate the hostel initially, but during my stay some tube stations were closed in this area which may explain…",Date of stay: May 2008,3.0

It is an easy underground ride from Heathrow, and with a few pounds and a little bit of time, you'll find yourself walking out of the underground station and looking at the hostel right across the street.  I have a terrible sense of direction, but finding the hostel was no problem.  It takes just a minute to get on the underground and access the rest of London.  Included in the rate was also a very simple continental breakfast - cereal, toast, peanut butter, and tea.  Nothing to write home about, but still a nice way to get started in the morning.
