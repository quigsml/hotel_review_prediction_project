The check in and check out were very smooth and the staff were very friendly. The reason for the mediocre review rating is that I stayed at this hotel 5 years ago, and with the exception of the change in name on the wall, nothing has really changed. The hallways are very tight, the rooms, although somewhat modern, are dated. 5 years ago, the apple TV/computer was a novelty, now it's small and outdated. From reading reviews it sounds like they are looking to upgrade the TV's. The bathrooms are clean, but very small. The room had a queen bed, but it was rock hard.

Room was nice, although they prepared a 3rd bed that wasn't needed, as it was only me in the room (not sure why they thought the booking was for 3).

Breakfast is a relaxed, self service affair with all the usual hot & cold offerings. Nothing special but more than adequate.

The furnishings in the room were a little basic. The bed was comfortable but the heating and duvet far too hot.  A wide selection of good food at breakfast.  The major problem was the TV and computer all in one device. The screen was far too small for a tv and the controls inefficient. I've decided against staying in another Doubletree hotel since as they have the same equipment and set up.  The lifts are also poorly designed. The ventilation or heating system near the lifts is fitted to the ceiling. The lights indicating which lift is coming are obscured by this and the doors close too quickly.

When I eventually negotiated my car through the tank trap obstacles at the car park entrance with an inch to spare on either side I found half the car park spaces had reserved signs - why if they cannot be reserved ? I ignored those signs. If one travels into a part of central London with very little alternative parking and are paying £30 for the privilege why cannot a space be reserved ? A guest with limited time to sort out alternative parking wants reassurance on this. Generally think twice about taking a large car into this car park unless you have excellent driving skills because it is simply not designed to be safe for anything bigger than a small car.…,Date of stay: October 2014,3.0

It is a nice neighborhood near the British Tate and it is easy to walk to local pubs and restaurants in Plimco.  It is short taxi ride (when you have your luggage!) from Victoria Station. On the other hand, our room was very small (very tight fit to get to second side of the bed), the service was spotty and the cost is high.

As regular visitors to London, we've stayed in lots of different hotels there ranging from big chains geared up for business travellers to small guest houses.  This is undoubtedly the best that we've experienced.  The rooms are light, airy and clean, the beds are extremely comfortable.  I can honestly say that I've never seen such a range of food on offer for breakfast - smoothies, wraps, pastries, fruit as well as some of the more usual fare.  The hotel is a short walk from the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey and so also convenient for the Underground, buses, etc.  Thoroughly recommended!

New, modern, clean and ... normal size rooms!  That is something rare for London, especially for the great weekend rates offered via their website.  The only thing to find anything to whine about would possibly be the location, being not so close to the center and a metro station. A small hint though -- use the bus no 88 that stops right next to the hotel to get to the center. That is especially useful when travelling late in the evening as the traffic is low and it only takes you 6-8 minutes to get to Piccadilly or Oxford Circus. That's the same time as getting to the Pimlico tube station. 88 bus has a 24-hour service. ",Date of stay: January 2006,5.0
