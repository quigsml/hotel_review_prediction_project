The first thing that I encountered was that there were no elevators, each floor being two flights of stairs. I decided to take a room on the second floor to avoid climbing the many stairs. Unfortunately, it was just above the pub which meant no sleep until after 2:00am. Another area where they came short was that there were only 2 shower stalls, one toilet and one sink on each floor to be shared among 20 guests per floor. You had to time your bathroom breaks just right if you wanted to use any of these.",Date of stay: March 2020,2.0

I was scammed out of money at this place, charged for nights I was NOT staying. My credit card was charged and I was told I would be receiving a refund after leaving this place because there was mice running through the rooms, old men sleeping in the beds while we are young female travelers, unclean bathrooms with blood all over the toilet seat. Nobody has returned my calls which leads me to wonder what type of establishment this place was.

Bad: There was one powerpoint in the room of 12 - which is a bit of a joke, to be honest. The staff tried to clean them, but the bathrooms were always dirty and smelt awful. There was only one or two showers and one or two toilets per floor (with a lot of people living on each floor). They have a kitchen, but it is very small and you have to hire pots, pans, etc if you actually want to cook something. Makes it such a hassle to use. There was no atmosphere and it wasn't really a nice place to hang out in.

Once the people from Dover just entered my locked room to check for bedbugs without any notice in advance so when I returned home after work I found my bedsheets on the floor and my room a mess.

It has a lot of potential, but never quite makes the cut. The staff is very friendly. Our main problems came with very loud roommates for two nights, not a very good breakfast, and the fact that 8 out of 10 times the nearby tube station was closed. The station at Dover Castle is only open during peak hours. So not before 10 AM, I believe it closes in the afternoon, and it does close early if you plan to stay out late. One other problem is that people left their stuff.
