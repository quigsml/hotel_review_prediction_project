We booked based on the photos on booking.com, trip advisor and the hotels own website. We booked a deluxe king room with balcony and view (room 550). This is NOT what we stayed in. We had a side view of the river, looking straight out onto a building. The room was tiny compared to what we were expecting based on the photos. This is false advertisement. The rooms air-conditioning was broken. We were shivering all night as there wasn’t even a way to turn this off. Cold air conditioning constant all night left us both sleepless and unhappy. The bathroom sink was too small to the point where the tap poured over the edge when you turned it on. The door to the balcony wouldn’t shut properly. If we opened the main room door, the balcony door would open. On the 2nd night we got in from our long day and around 11pm we called the main desk were we explained the air con issue. They sent up an engineer and it was apparent even he couldn’t work out the air con. He brought up a portable heater which we had to use all night. They did offer us another room however, with it being 11:20pm at night on our last night, we thought this was pointless and we were just tired.  Amongst all these negatives we will give credit where it is due. The staff in the breakfast restaurant were impeccable and the breakfast itself was amazing even due to the covid restrictions. The room and hotel itself was clean and the boat to Canary Wharf was a great plus. Safe to say we will not be staying here again. However the staff are lovely.…",Date of stay: December 2020,1.0

Unfortunate experience in the restaurant - spent around 4.5 hours of our evening having incorrect or cold meals given to us.

Also the fact you can take a complimentary boat across the Thames has a certain appeal.

It’s a 15-20 min walk to Canada Water, or 5-10 mins from one of the Canary Wharf stations followed by the boat crossing which can require a 15 min wait if you don’t time it right.

On the Friday when we were due to check in i called ahead to see if I could upgrade our first night to the queen suit- the lady in the phone was so helpful and happy to oblige- we had the queen room with the view for both nights at no extra cost. This came with free access to the executive lounge with free drinks and snacks between 6-9pm . This was a lovely way to start the evening or an excuse to get out of your room.

As usual, the staff is great. Room was contemporary and clean although the layout of the place is a bit wonky. Being on this waterfront, it's a series of interconnected buildings so you're not really going to get anywhere in a big hurry.   The drawback of this place is that if like me, you want to take the tube everywhere around London this is not the place. It's fairly isolated although on the map it might look like it's not too far. One can take a car/taxi to a tube station for $7-10 so it's not a big deal but just something to be aware of. They also constantly have a ferry going back and forth across the Thames so you can take that and then walk to the Canary Wharf…",Date of stay: March 2017,4.0

As it turned out, I was unable to attend with my friends so booked separately and took my mum.  My friends had warned me not to expect the sandwiches or cakes to be refilled upon request.  This seems to be a source of disappointment for many on here, so I was glad my expectations were managed.  At the end of the day when you're only spending £14.50pp, I don't think you can expect what you might have experienced at other London hotels, which usually charge a minimum of £35pp (but often double this!) to have a constant supply of sandwiches.

The location across the river from Canary Wharf is good, as long as you have business to do there. Otherwise, it's a pain to have to come back there via boat or taxi.  That's about it for the positive...  The hotel describes their rooms as newly refurbished, which amazes me as in most rooms the carpets needs replacing. I find that there is a moldy smell (stronger in same places than in others) that goes through the hotel. In some parts of the hotel, in the corridors especially, the smell is unbearable.  The biggest problem is simply the poor infrastructure/insolation of the buildings.

There was a step down to the bathroom which became a trip hazard for children coming out of the bathroom. 2. The shutters on the window didn't stay back against the wall and swung out and being so close to the bed was a danger of walking into it or hitting your head on it, which I did.

It's hardly a vaporetto into Venice but it's pretty cool. The hotel has a great setting on the banks of the Thames looking back across to the Canary Wharf financial district.

We ate at the restaurant on the first night which was decent. And were given breakfast on the Sunday which was plentiful. And we were given extra, freshly made pancakes. Would stay again if I could guarantee the same rooms. Special shout out to Frances who was amazing during our stay and a credit to the hotel. ",Date of stay: June 2015,5.0

The rooms are not Hilton specs and the signage outside tells you it is a Double Tree not a Hilton, the maintenance also leaves a lot to be desired.  In spite of this the hotel is being miss-sold as a Hilton on the HHonors website and App.  When attending shows at the Excel I normally stay at the Novotel Excel but this year left it too late so booked this hotel instead, if you need a room for a night then this hotel is fine.  The good; Efficient check out, clean room and very pleasant staff, on a nice evening the heated terrace along the river is very comfortable to relax and chat with a drink. The hotel is located in a quiet residential area.  The bad; Check In took for ever. Poky little rooms and ours had a tiny hexagonal…",Date of stay: June 2015,3.0

I wasn´t expecting the best room in the hotel. What I was expecting was clean, comfortable and quiet room. What I got was a tiny room, on the ground floor where the bathroom fan/airduct was disgusting (I have a picture on my phone will add it later), there was staff/renovation workers outside of the room with noise in the morning, so no sleeping in. The wet walls, and the paint smells on the hallway didn´t bother me or the workers I kind of expected them when I read the bad reviews. What I didn´t expect was dirty room and lack of sleep, due to the noice outside of the room, we couldn´t keep the window open so it our room was stuffy and hot.

As on previous visits we had booked a room with a balcony - lovely to watch the comings and goings on the Thames and see the beautiful reflections on the water. The ferry across the river is a brilliant no extra cost for hotel guests and saves both time and money. The newly decorated and refurnished room was well set out the only drawback was you still have the small step between the room and ensuite. Within easy distance of a good variety of restaurants.,Date of stay: May 2015,4.0

We had a very small room on the top (4th) floor, that felt like being put in the attic. (SO tiny, look at the pictures!)  The only window was a velux that was open when we arrived so the room was freezing.  This window looked straight into the opposite bedrooms velux! (See picture) The curtains didn't cut out any light so we had to stuff the opening with cushions.  There was no fridge and water as advertised and definitely no river views!  Underground car park was very small and mostly full of stacked mattresses and workmen's tools.  A ""Refurbishment"" everywhere just meant gloss paint smell and wet paint.  The bed was a very uncomfortable double that whilst being tiny, still managed to look too big in the very tiny room. It was shoved against…",Date of stay: June 2015,1.0

It is older, there is a maze you have to walk through to get to your room, but I do like it. There is something nice about being on the balcony of your room and watching the tide go in and out.  The staff is accommodating, it is fairly peaceful, if you like to be on the water.  This is my second review, but for the price, I am okay with the downsides.  The first is the access to the hotel, you either need to take the C10 from the Canada Water station, or walk from the Waterferry station and ferry over, or go to Canary Warf station and walk and take the water ferry.  I'm down with both.  there is  a bunch of stores at the Canary Warf station, there is a whole mall there.

This was meant to be a very special 8 year anniversary weekend for me and my partner. I had the whole thing planned out from the hotel on the dockets, to trips to the london dungeon and the London eye, to lunch at Gordon Ramsay's Union Street Cafe then a viewing at the Shard where I would bend a knee and pop the big question...
