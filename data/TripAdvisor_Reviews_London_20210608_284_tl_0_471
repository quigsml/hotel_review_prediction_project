Right next to bus station and train station. Very handy. The staff are really friendly and helpful.  The rooms are clean and the bed is very comfortable. It's just a very standard hotel, as Travelodges' are, but no problem at all. I suppose if you aren't used to the area, it can seem a little sketchy as you do get the odd smell of weed and noise coming from car park area, but for a night or two, the hotel is absolutely fine. Clean and comfy place to stay.",Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

Pulled the single beds apart to find two half eaten pizzas. No way the beds could have been changed without seeing them so obvious the bedding was the same as previous occupants. At first the manager would not acknowledge that the beds had not been changed but did offer to remake the beds. Then offered us another room which we accepted. I was annoyed that he continued to insist the beds had been changed so we put the beds back together and asked him to show us how this was possible.
