Room was clean and lovely! Access to town brilliant!  How ever reason for my review me and my partner was trying to sleep through out the night, unfortunately this was not the case. There was a few women running up and down the corridor screaming there mouths off acting extremely immature. Following to that there was men doing the same thing there was door slamming, shouting, by the sounds of it then men was telling the women to go away but they refused....This was going on for a few Hours.  I tried to call reception no answer! Unfortunately I wasn’t able to go down to reception due to a personal reason of why I am here.  The hotel was great it’s self but I don’t recommend this if you are here on personal or emergency reasons and need to rest as clearly others have no respect for others.  Thank You…",Date of stay: May 2021,2.0

The room was basic but spotlessly clean, quiet and the bed comfortable. I really like that the Ibis is trying to be more eco friendly with the shower products.

My -only- issue with the hotel at this point, is that it is getting very dated. The TV is tiny, the bathroom door didn't close properly, the corridor carpets are worn and the decor is getting very dated.

It’s a typical Ibis budget hotel with basic facilities. There’s nothing luxurious about Ibises so once you have that in mind, it’s easy to just enjoy it for what it is. Pros-The bed was comfortable enough, water pressure in the bathroom was good and I enjoyed the full English breakfast that was served in the mornings. The staff were also helpful and friendly. Cons- The towels provided are too small and thin and the rooms could do with more lighting as I found mine quite dark.  For a comfortable, no frills stay, i’d recommend here.

Then, there are the threadbare towels that feel like paper on your skin. If you want to work, well watch out for the counter edge which has whittled down to wood shards. Since there is no fan in the bathroom, you will want to open the window for the condensation to disperse and there, you will find the window is surrounded by black mold!

This was such a lovely little touch and much appreciated. The rooms was lovely and we had a nice comfortable stay. The following morning we went down for a lovely buffet breakfast and again the staff surprised me with some chocolates and a slice of cake with a candle in it and sang me Happy Birthday!

The room would turn into a steam sauna after having a shower. One of the bedside tables was very dirty with food and glass rings all over.

Great find.,"An Ibis is an Ibis, isn’t it?  They’re all pretty much “à la formule”;  what sets one apart from the others is the staff and the service.   This one is conveniently located a five minute walk from Shepherd’s Bush tube, and 10 minutes from Westfield shopping centre, and its large and relatively inexpensive car parks.   The room was clean, warm and comfortable, although the wooden floor makes it feel a bit Spartan.  The only real niggle is the WC & Shower pod, which has a hugely noisy door catch, and lights up the room like daylight at night, making it impossible to use without waking anyone else in the room.  The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.  Breakfast is a buffet affair, and a very good one, too.  The “acid test” scrambled eggs were very good indeed,…",Date of stay: April 2018,4.0

There are NO brochures for any attractions available, in fact I found many more freely available at many tube stations. On arrival I was given a key card for a room that was still very occupied; embarrassment for me as well as the sleeping occupant!

The room was on the 4th floor and near the back of the hotel.  All the basics and very clean. The bed was very comfortable and there was barely any noise from outside other than the odd siren but not enough to cause disruption. Three great nights sleep +++++ The only issue I had really was the breakfast I think was over priced for a buffet. Good quality food and quite a wide range.   Other than that it was a great stay and would definatly come here again for future visits.  Thank you Ibis ,Date of stay: July 2016,5.0

Less good: breakfast was a little uninspiring, luckily I had found a good B&B rate so it was in effect free. Not good: they turn off the cooling function of the air con on cold days. My room was too hot and the only was to cool it was to open the window; traffic noise was a problem. Terrible: I reported a faulty power socket. It was not fixed.

There is a big Westfield mall nearby, but we didn’t have time to visit.  We had a standard room, clean and modern.  It was a bit small but more than adequate for two and for our needs.  The bathroom was enclosed in an interesting circular pod within the room.

The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in!  The breakfast is really good value at £8.95 a head for a 'all you can eat' buffet of both hot and cold food.  I would definitely stay here again and would also recommend to family and friends.

It was also handy for the tube – about 5 minutes’ walk from Shepherds Bush station and about the same from Goldhawk Road tube.  The lobby and reception area were tastefully decorated and the whole hotel smelt new and clean. All the hotel staff were very friendly.  Was very impressed with the accommodation: really comfy beds, no external noise and just the right temperature in the room.  Shower gel and soap was provided and there was also a hairdryer in the room and tea and coffee.  The bathroom was in a sort of cabin or pod within the room and…",Date of stay: October 2012,5.0

Location is great, and the Tube station is across the road. Very convenient central line tube (10 -15 minutes) to Oxford circus, and central London.  Room -  outstanding - was a pleasure to sleep in a bed that no-one else had EVER slept in. Bathroom - no toilet paper when I arrived - WHO checked the room? Bathroom - for days 2 and 3, no plastic cups - again - WHO checked the room? Breakfast - Outstanding! Except when we left at 6 am, breakfast was not ready. I understood that it was to be cold buffet between 6 and 8, but there was very little on offer. During the few minutes we had, one of the staff busied herself by putting food out - very nice, but we had no time to eat it!! It should have been…",Date of stay: October 2012,4.0

This time we were much happier: the hotel opened this month (October), so all the furniture still smelled of new. The room size is decent, the SAT television ok, the bed extremely comfortable. Absolutely needed are drawers in the wardrobe, which is instead completely open (and not big enough). The bathroom is not very big too, and there is not the mop to clean the water, which is absurd of course, but perhaps it's early stage and the hotel isn't fully furnished yet. Breakfast is rich and good taste. We haven't eaten there so can't comment about the restaurant. We'll surely come back unless the price won't rise too much (we think the price we paid was so…",Date of stay: October 2012,4.0

OK, it's a fair bit out of the center, but still very close to a U station and with great shopping/dining opportunities very close by. Since it opened just a while ago, everything's still new and clean. The reception area is nice and has plenty of newspapers and magazines for you to enjoy. The rooms are very similar to the rooms in this chain of hotels; a nice touch was the water boiler with coffee, milk & sugar. The only minus to my taste is the size of the beds : I cannot sleep in such narrow beds. I've written this before about the Ibis in Lyon. In Shanghai the beds were larger, but there we had booked the more expensive room,…",Date of stay: October 2012,4.0

It's a new hotel(opened 5days before we stopped) so it still had that new smell lol. Room was very clean and average size. The hotel is 1min walk from shephards bush tube station and 2min walk from a massive Westfield shopping centre, there's also a cinema and loads of restaurants just a 1min walk away.

The location was fantastic, just across the road from the tube and a 5 minute walk to Westfields Shopping Mall which was a treat in itself.

The rooms were functional and well designed with a desk area and seat, another padded seat, shelving and hanging area with proper hangers and a propert hair dryer!  The bathroom was well sized overall with a big shower and the water pressure and heat were good.  Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet.  The hotel provided an ironing board and iron promptly when I rang reception and happily booked us a taxi and fixed the price for it too.  Parking tip - there is an NCP on the rooftop of West 21 shopping centre which has direct entry into the Ibis and so is extremely convenient but isn't mentioned on their website.  This was £20 for 24 hours and is outside the congestion zone.  Friendly, well designed and ideally…",Date of stay: October 2012,5.0
