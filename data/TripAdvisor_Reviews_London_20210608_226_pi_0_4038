A couple of really poor reviews recently worried me but I found they couldn’t be further from my experience, they just had bad luck I guess. I have stayed in ‘Hubs’ in other locations and had great experiences and, coming to London Sept 20th/22nd had no hesitation in booking the Hub Covent Garden.  Generally a fantastic location just off Covent Garden and surrounded by lovely pubs and restaurants. Within minutes you can walk to Leicester Square, Piccadilly, Trafalgar Square and the Embankment, (for the water taxi) as well as Covent Garden of course. Arriving at the Hub there is a clear one way system, the automated check in hubs are all individually screened, there is sanitizer available everywhere. A lovely helpful lady, behind a screen and wearing PPE was available to check me in as I’m not keen on the machines. The room was as expected, excellent. It was scrupulously clean and as well equipped as I anticipated. There was ample hot water and I found it lovely and quiet despite being on a low level floor. Breakfast is available and again all served in an adapted, clean, screened restaurant with table service and again, really pleasant, helpful staff in PPE. It’s also great value. (Tea, porridge, toast, £5) I really believe, for the price, there isn’t a better place to stay in London. On a general note on the area I found that all the bars and restaurants I used were implementing Covid procedures and doing well in keeping me safe. Most (but sadly not all) people were following the rules.  I thoroughly…",Date of stay: September 2020,5.0

However... the service left a lot to be desired.  The app did not work for the entirety of the stay, meaning that all of the hi-tech features were pointless. But this was the least of my issues. I was woken up very suddenly by a false fire drill. This itself it fair enough, but guests were left not knowing what was going on or whether to evacuate or not.

The HUB is more of a Hutch with all room facilities as a pod. The bed can only be accessed from one side so you better not have anything to drink after 8 pm.  The lighting system means that a nighttime visit to the loo needs all pod lighting on to achieve it safely.  The aircon has a mind of its own deciding when to flip to heating from cooling.

The staff were so friendly and helpful and the rooms were perfectly clean (and I have high standards!). It’s in such a good location as it’s less than a five minute walk to Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Hippodrome Casino and Covent Garden. The deli that is in the hotel is such a lovely bonus and serves great food. I felt safe staying here as a solo female and it exceeded my expectations. The only thing it doesn’t have in the room is shampoo and conditioner but you can buy these from the hotel vending machine which was a really quirky and helpful feature for those forgotten items! The hotel also kindly stored my luggage after check out whilst I did some sightseeing before returning home which was so handy.…",Date of stay: February 2019,5.0

Location is excellent for theatres, Covent Garden, Leicester Square etc. Staff were brilliant upon check in. We checked in a good hour early with no issues.  Our room was small, but was expecting this having read the reviews. But for £70 for the night in this location, I couldn’t complain!  Hotel feels very safe as you need your room key to get on to each floor. Service excellent, free tea and coffee 24/7 in the bar downstairs, rooms spotlessly clean and modern. Didn’t mind the small room as travelling without the kids. Probably not ideal for a family visit, unless they have family rooms? Would Defo stay here again. ",Date of stay: November 2017,5.0

The rooms are compact but really well thought out, no problems whatsoever. If you like to pack 20 outfits then it won't work for you.  Check in and out was a breeze and you can store you luggage before and after your check in/out (charity donations are a great idea). The best thing is that the location is absolutely amazing, nothing comes close for the price. Premier Inn's new concept of these compact, central rooms is a definite winning formula.

It is a new concept for Premier Inn.   My room was in the basement and was incredibly compact although trendily appointed. It was more of a little pod than a room and had no windows!

I would normally give the place 5 stars, but some of your staff, especially this one particular girl, has a terrible attitude. Yes, I'm from NI, however that does not mean you have the right to sneer at me, be condescending and take an attitude with someone nearly twice your age. Shameful. Still love the hotel, but you should screen your staff a lot better. I will not be staying here again, as I don't want to be treated like a ""country bumpkin"". Your staff should be sensitive to other nationalities and people with different backgrounds.

The idea is that everything is electronic and can be operated from a mobile phone app, but in reality this doesn't really work and the minimalist strategy in term of staff makes the usual service you'd expect quit difficult to obtain. We booked a room for 2 people but were only provided with one towel. It took a number of attempts to finally manage to get a second one brought to the room. The 'smart' tv in the room was completely useless. The clever lighting is just annoying and you cannot switch the lights on in the tiny bathroom without turning all of the room lights on.

The Room was small, the bunk bed was inconvenient, the hanging space was small and the shower room with glass walls was cramped, badly designed with a useless modern hand basin. There was no tea and coffee facilities in the room so you had to go down stairs to the café to get it, but half the time nothing worked properly or wasn't available.

Understatement to say the least. The rooms are so small that I don't know how two adults are meant to sleep comfortably, subsequently had the worst nights sleep I think I've ever had.  No windows that open so rely on air con, we both had stuffed up noses so some fresh air would've been nice.   The staff were friendly but none committal when we complained. Didn't seem to know who was in charge.   If you're travelling alone this hotel would be fine but if you're over 5'6 I don't think you'd even fit in the bed. ",Date of stay: June 2015,1.0

But even so I usually stay on the outskirts and tube in, as the Central London locations are too pricey for me. Well, no more. The new Hub concept is a boutique style capsule hotel - the rooms are small but ensuite, comfy, secure, incredibly stylish, and have free wifi - and the prices are half that of a full scale Central London Premier. Designed for the lone business traveler or maybe a couple staying for a night, the Hub is absolutely perfect. I shall be using this hotel a lot. This is the only Hub at present.

We normally stay in Premier Inns and like them for their good standard and reliable service. This one was a great place to stay, cheaper than many other hotels. Location is excellent. Clean and very quiet. Not sure it's to every ones tastes. If you're used to a large room and stuffy B&Bs then this is not for you. We loved it though and will definitely go back again. You do need to be comfortable with the person you stay with as its easy to see into the bathroom; you may not want to stay for more than a weekend due to its size. Very friendly staff and easy to find. Use the Leicester Square tube station as the Covent Garden one is slightly further away.",Date of stay: January 2015,4.0

There is an air conditioner suitable for a room ten times the size of this room so when it was on we had a blast of air from one end of the room to the other, not comfortable.
