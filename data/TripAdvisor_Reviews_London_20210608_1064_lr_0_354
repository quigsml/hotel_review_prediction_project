First of all the attitude of staff is very bad. Secondly the room was filthy and I got bites from bed bugs. Thirdly they threw me out because they claimed I hadn’t booked long enough which was an absolute lie ! I had booked six nights and they phoned me the fifth day and told me to come get my bags or they were going in the street. I had also got mail sent there which apparently never arrived even though it was sent first class. All in all the hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in and I work away a lot and have stayed in some bad places. So just a little advice never stay here or you will find out for yourself what it’s like.,Date of stay: July 2020,1.0

Our room was clean and the receptionist was polite. The location of the hotel is perfect. In 1 minute you reach the metro station, restaurants&supermarkets.   not-so-good things about the hotel: -Very bad shower/bathroom  - weird smell inside the room - breakfast is served only for 1 hour per day and it is very crowded and hot inside the dining room.

Good location close to Earl’s Court train station. Easy walk to Hyde Park and the museums. Lots of shops, cafes and take aways near by. The room had 3 single beds which suited us fine. Beds made up neatly. A wardrobe with draws (although the draws had stuff in from previous occupants so we did not use them) a TV and a desk. Plenty of plug sockets. Some of the light bulbs needed changing. The bathroom was tiny and smelt like cigarette smoke. Shower was nice and powerful though.  Breakfast was self service. Not a huge variety - Cornflakes and toast. Coffee, tea and orange juice. The dining room is quite small and as they only serve breakfast for an hour there isn’t enough room for all the guests.  Staff were polite, no problems.  I don’t think I’d stay here again. Although the price was reasonable for 1 adult 2 children, I’d rather spend a bit extra and go somewhere a nicer.

Unless we were very unlucky and got the worst room in the hotel, believe me, the rooms are not clean! The carpet was filthy, the walls were stained, the toilet was mouldy, the bedspread was dirty! There was a cockroach in the toilet. I know it's very affordable  and the location is great but it's not worth it, believe me! I'd rather pay a bit more and sleep in a clean comfortable bed.  Plus: too noisy, the water was either too cold or too hot; there were no window shades and the room was tiny!",Date of stay: November 2009,1.0

Own shower and toilet, clean towels daily, refrigerator in room etc. Very obliging friendly staff. Breakfast is toast fruit drink and tea coffee etc but you can have cereal yoghurt etc before you go if you get organised. This Hotel saved us many dollars travelling on a tight budget. If not happy pay more and stay else where what can you expect for this cost in a city like London? Beats camping!",Date of stay: August 2009,4.0

I found the staff friendly,breakfast was tea/coffee and toast which was lovley. If you close your window the tube trains sounds like a strong breeze outside.

It is basic, certainly, but it is clean, warm and very well situated.

Obviously when you pay £50 for a room for one night in London you don't expect the earth, but I do expect a clean, safe room.  When we arrived we had to ring a bell for the receptionist, who kind of grunted at us and pointed at breakfast and check out times. not great customer service. We had room 1 which was opposite the dining room, and I think directly over the tube line as I was awoken at about 5am with the sound of trains which continued every 10 mins... not great for a nights sleep.  The main light from the ceiling had no shade and the electrics were exposed on the ceiling. the bathroom was mouldy and made me feel quite sick.…",Date of stay: July 2009,1.0

I stayed ther one night as it was near the Cromwell hospital-the location is the only thing going for it. The room was minute and filthy. Wasn't sure what the stain on the wall was and didn't want to ask. The previous guest had left things in the fridge and I had to get the porter to move them-needless to say one of them was a banana so the fridge stunk. On suite was tiny and the hand basin is by the bed! My advise: go somewhere else, any where else!!!",Date of stay: February 2009,1.0

Along with the central location the price is the biggest attraction for this hotel.  We stayed in a basic double room which had a small double bed, a closet, fridge, tv and washbasin. Bathroom was outside the room and shared with other guests.  The rooms are nothing fancy but they are clean, comfortable enough and cheap as chips for London. Tea/ instant coffee, toast and jam are included for breakfast.  This is definately a cheap but cheerful place which will not be suitable for all travellers. If you want something a bit newer, more homely and still central, you'll need to pay alot more for it in London.   Consider the price and your length of stay, we found it okay for our two nights but I know…",Date of stay: November 2008,3.0

I mean after we left the so called ""hotel"" ( in Germany you would never get offered a place like this as a hotel!!)we went through London to find something else to stay for the night and we saw many youth hostels and hotels but none of those were as ugly as this!We would NEVER EVER come back to this place.",Date of stay: May 2008,1.0

The en-suite was even worse & the shower leaked leaving the floor wet all the time. The room smelt of smoke and the bed felt like the springs were poking through the matress.

A nice converted Victorian house, I was led to believe. Well, the price was incredibly cheap, and since we were a group of guys who just wanted a place to sleep, it suited us well.  The sheets were always clean, and the continental breakfast (coffee, tea, ""orange juice"", toast and a selection of jams and butter) was abundant enough, but the breakfast room, in the basement with no outside window, does little to whet your apetite.   Overall the place is shabby, staff indifferent and businesslike and the rooms are cramped.

Next  I was directed down to my basement room by rude impatient staff. It was cramped, stuffy and small enough to be most hotels bathroom. A winodw led out onto a yard of some sort, and since half the room was underground anyone could jump in if the window was left open. I did NOT feel safe here.   The en suite bathroom and carpet were ridiculously dirty and the toilet was broken. Streaks of scum actually covered the shower wall and floor. It was disgusting.
