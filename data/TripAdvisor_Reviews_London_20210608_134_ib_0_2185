Room was compact but was fine for the 3 nights my children and I stayed. Room had everything needed, coffee, iron, hairdryer and a good size TV. Room (238) was street facing but no issue with noise at all. Bed was really comfy so we all had great nights sleep which was needed after long days exploring. Shower was decent and although bathroom would steam up within minutes after use would be normal again. The only issue was that there was no plug where the coffee making facilities were so I had to put the kettle on the floor in front of the mirror. Minor inconvenience and not sure whether that was an issue because furniture was moved to accommodate the additional bed?!   Location was excellent. Right next to the station which is on the District and Hammersmith line. So perfect for those wanting to explore London. Quite a few sites within walking distance also.  I was also able to check out late for £10 which meant our mini holiday lasted longer without stressing about our luggage. Can't fault the staff either who were helpful and polite. All in all for the price, location, amenities etc it was perfect and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend or stay there again if the price was similar to what I paid.…",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

The servicing of the room was top class BUT the TV was clunky to use and I had to replace the remote control three times as wasn't one in the room to start and next two the batteries were too low to run it. As other reviewers said breakfast was borderline farcical. I stayed four nights and for four breakfasts so know of what I speak. It didn't seem busy but you had to queue (Covid rules) and be served buffet style by  a staff member..who I am guessing was new? As other reviewers have pointed out they were forgetful. You had to ask for things which just didn't turn up. The one day it worked fine as the staff member was excellent but the last day I think the staff were just not good enough..you asked for toast...no sign...couldn't get your own of course. Condiments...Hmmmm....one of the two coffee machines just didn't work...oh! and there were the silver tubes that are used for ""Recreational"" drug use? Outside one room for hours. But the cleaners of the rooms were wonderful so hats off for that. I have stayed at many hotels in the area and unfortunately this one didn't rte for me. It was the breakfast experience. Just not good.…",Date of stay: June 2021,3.0

But the issues are the operational side of things mainly around yhe breakfast service. Which felt unorganised and chaotic, the hot breakfast is buffet style where you que and tell the staff what you want the issues is the staff member was getting panicked so was rushing and forgetting things. Where as at premier inn they come take your hot breakfast order to help reduce unnecessary movement, the next concern was mask wearing when you enter there is a sign saying where your make and when you check your advises to when moving about but it appears the staff aren't enforcing this meaning people are wondering around with mask which is uncomfortable.",Date of stay: May 2021,2.0

Good friendly service from staff and I thought the effort they went to over Halloween was amazing!!  The room is a new Ibis design and much better than older dated ones.   The only negative that makes it average and not very good on the ratings is the outside noise. We had a fairly high up room facing the back road and you still get a load of shouting from people coming back from the pubs, sirens, car noise and the like.  Maybe thicker glazing would help?

Well, there's a reason why there were still available rooms 24 hours before our arrival. Though the location is okay and personel is really friendly and helpful, the hotel doesn't make the cut. The rooms, in particular, are not up to the tasks. The first one was very small and 2 meters away from the adjacent building's AC ... we changed. The second one was better, with a nicer view, but the AC was not working and the bathroom was really not nice: a small plastic box with a broken and rusty sliding door, poor ventilation, dirty floors and not enough towels.

The only downside for me and maybe the reason I look at another hotel in the area is that a few months ago this hotel stopped providing newspapers for guests to read.  I,  like others use to like reading a newspaper whilst having breakfast or whilst sitting in the lounge, but this appears to have been stopped due to cost savings.

Good value.,This is a typical Ibis hotel on a great location just 2 minutes from Aldgate East tube station. Just leave the station using the Toynbe Exit - turn left and your there. Early check in online means minimum of fuss when you arrive. Pay an extra £10 and you can check on from 9.00. The rooms are clean and modern and the bed is comfy. Air Conditioning works well. Bathroom is their pod type with a good shower. Breakfast is buffet type with s good choice of cold and cooked items. Cooked items however seemed to always be lukewarm and a choice of eggs would have been good as the scrambled eggs tended to be a bit dry.

The hotel is new (opened in june 2005), the room was very clean and the service was good. The price is reasonable. Nothing to complain about. As the hotel is really only 100 m from Aldgate East tube station it's perfectly situated. We would stay there again without any doubt. ",Date of stay: October 2005,4.0
