Although Travelodge is a budget option this hotel is nicely appointed and the rooms quiet and clean.

For example I like a room on a high floor to avoid street noise if there is any and in this location it’s very likely. Although I left my bags in bag store early by the time I formally checked in (very late) I was left with a room on the 1st floor. If they recorded my preferences they’d know.
