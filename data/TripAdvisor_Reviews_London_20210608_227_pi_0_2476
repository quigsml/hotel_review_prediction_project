I have already booked another stay here.   We loved the quiet location. It's not quite in Docklands but there is a DLR station v close by. Outside the hotel is a waterside walkway which is ideal for watching planes take-off and land at London City Airport.   Breakfast was great - no problems with ordering rather than the traditional buffet.   The staff were all welcoming, friendly and helpful. I did have to ask for the sofa bed to be made up, but this was sorted quickly and with minimum fuss.   I had called to ask for a room with views of the airport and DLR trains - so we were delighted with our room. The water pressure in the shower was lovely and strong. No complaints about cleanliness.   Overall, a fantastic stay. ",Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

There is a £12 to park the car for the day whereas some of the others do not charge which added to the final bill if you are watching what you spend.

Also, the staff were polite and friendly, which made a massive difference.  For this Premier Inn, I don't think their company strap line is quite appropriate: ""Everything is premier except the price"". I would say that £170 for a room, per night, is quite premier.

I was a little apprehensive at first, as I usually prefer 'proper' Hotels.  However, my friends booked the Trip and so I was taken for the ride !  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  The location is ideal for Excell, Literally walking distance. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room comfortable, well sized and the Bed was superb.  Plenty of Hot Water was also much appreciated.  My only complaint was that I found the room a little cold and the heater ineffective. However the friendly staff were happy to provide me with a little fan heater which resolves that very minor issue.  Overall, an excellent and great value stay.

We had breakfast and dinner there and both were really good value for money and excellent food.  Only gripe would be the car parking fees.  Depending on what time of day you arrive you could end up paying £12 for a days parking.  It is free between 5.30pm and 9.30am and is owned by…",Date of stay: June 2006,3.0

Rooms are standard Travel Inn fare, ie comfortable and clean. Bathrooom spotless with high pressure shower and bath.  Now a charge for parking £12 per day. Machine was faulty when I was there causing much hassle.   Long waits to be seated in the restuarant in the evening and morning. I seated myself both morning after getting bored waiting.  Buffet dinner and breakfast food is sometimes slow to appear.  Overall though worth £60 per night. ",Date of stay: April 2006,3.0

I am reviewing the hotel according to its type, obviously you won't expect chandeliers in a budget hotel for example. I'll try to be as balanced as I can.  Bad points  Location. This hotel is quite a way out of town, which means approx 25 min journey to travel in, on the Docklands Light Railway and so of course there's the cost of fares. We bought all-zones travel cards anyway so it didn't matter to us and we used them all week. We actually liked the journey at the beginning and end of each day, passing the docklands, which is very varied and interesting to see.

The hotel has friendly and courteous staff, the rooms are quite spacious and include a large sofa, the showers are good, and the breakfast is nice. It's a bit out of the way from central London (2 changes on the train), but if your business is at ExCel or Docklands in general, this hotel is a good choice. It's also very near City Airport.
