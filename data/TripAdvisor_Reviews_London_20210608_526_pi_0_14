A very well designed use of space means that the compact, modern rooms (i.e. hubs!) provide all amenities yet don't feel cramped. Hotel opened in Jan-20, so was new and clean as you'd expect. Exceptionally well located, less than one minute walk from West Brompton station, so it's very accessible to Heathrow & Gatwick as well as central London. Nice neighbourhood, with nice local bars & cafes within a short walk. All complemented by very friendly & helpful staff. All in all, a perfect hotel for a single traveler visiting London on business or leisure.",Date of stay: February 2020,5.0

With a tube station next door, you can be in the city centre within minutes, or even walk if you feel like it as we did one day.  Lots of bars and restaurants close by. Hub team extremely welcoming, friendly and efficient.  I told them it was my partner’s 50th during our stay and we arrived back at our room to find a bottle of Prosecco, chocolates and a card. So thoughtful and much appreciated. Will definitely come here again. ",Date of stay: February 2020,5.0

(except refrigerator) Good access, cheap and tidy. I think it would be better to give a discount to those who stay long term. If you are staying for a long time, the laundry is a bit of a problem, but I would like to have a laundry service.",Date of stay: February 2020,5.0

As soon as we arrived we had a great welcome from the manager and all the staff we encountered over our stay were friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.  The lounge area is relaxing and comfy. The bar is reasonable considering you are in London. Our room was clean and had a small window overlooking a busy pub... which we hardly heard so great soundproofing.  The location is perfect for exploring London and close to the tube and easily accessible if travelling in to Paddington. Great value for money and will definitely be staying here again.  ,Date of stay: February 2020,5.0

Usual Hub format, same rapid check-in process, same room layout, everything worked correctly, no problems at all and at an excellent price for London. Location is ok but not the best, handy for the tube but quite a way out from the real centre of London. Some decent food places within walking distance though. ",Date of stay: February 2020,5.0
