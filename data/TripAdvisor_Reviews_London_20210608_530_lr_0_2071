Although, a few cons for me, no powerpoints near the beds meant either using battery packs (if you had one) or leaving your phone on the other side of the room...  also, not allowed any outside food which meant you could only eat at the ‘restaurant’ inside, which was okay... but not my kind of thing!

They're used by everyone on the floor, aren't clean, and the showers are tiny without space for storing stuff.

That evening I ordered the ""vegetarian"" ravioli, which wasn't vegetarian as they had stated on the menu, as there was Parmesan sprinkled on top. I asked for the pasted to be served without the Parmesan, which I believed to be a simple enough request. When I got my dish, it was covered in Parmesan despite my clear preference to eat it without. The pasta was not nice at all…",Date of stay: September 2016,3.0

We asked for a 10 bed for space but were crammed into a 4 bedroom with the heater blaring and no way to turn it off. Once complaining security came in and asked us 'what do you want' and were completely rude to us.  We booked a late check out but our cards for our rooms stopped working at 10am.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and would heavily suggest the staff (especially the security) to be less rude on arrival. You made myself feel very unwelcome.

We had booked a double room with private bath. Room was clean and comfortable. Only negative was lack of plugs- Only had 1 outlet...in this day and age we all need somewhere to charge.. The bathroom was very modern, a little strange that the shower was basically open in the bathroom- no shower walls- which results in getting the entire bathroom floor wet- so once you shower, the floor remains wet for a few hours- so using the toilet or sink will result in wet feet, and a little slippery!   The location is a little hard to find- have to walk down an alley off the road to find the hostel- which can be a little daunting if you are traveling alone at night.

A space for your luggage under the bed, bring your own locks. But again  because the room is so small, it is very difficult to pack or unpack. I had to pack outside the room before I leave.  Toilets dont have much privacy, but this is a hostel. Hot water is aplenty though.   The lounge and bar is huge and there's always space to sit around.

The bathrooms were clean and having a locker under the bed was helpful (Remember to bring a lock!) There was a mix up with beds, but that was sorted. The staff had a sense of humour and were pretty friendly. Laundry facilities too! Very helpful! The guests were mainly younger, although that was not a problem for me.

This is a fabulous art deco building with nicely designed social areas.  There was quite a range of age-groups staying and many different needs seem to be well catered for, from families to groups of students.  I read an earlier review where there were concerns about noise; and although noise was not a problem for me, I feel that in such a large hostel perhaps there could be an option for people to select a quieter area if they prefer.  With respect to the bathrooms, they are never perfect in a hostel.  There were hooks to hang clothes but there are no shelves.

The hostel itself is freshly renovated and tries to look very suited for young people. The bar was cool and the interior was...unique. However we got possibly the worst room they had to offer. It was obviously a reconstructed broom closet!! Very narrow room with 2 bunk beds squeezed in! There was absolutely NO space to put your suitcase, your belongings or even your toilet bag. Not even a coat hanger was to find on the walls, even for a hostel I find this a bit poor. The price was not that cheap as I could say OK I had to expect this. The room was also pretty cold. Also there was a staircase next to our room and the whole night drunk teenagers kept running up and down the stairs, banging on our door and screaming…",Date of stay: May 2013,3.0

Even the location is great we had a terrible nights so many times (between the guy who played piano until 4 am and the ring alarm early the morning how are we supposed to sleep??)  Plus the Stass was not as friendly as i imagine, it's like they doesn't care about you, ok there are polite but not more.  And the room, she was disgusting during 3 days until one person came to empty the garbadge.  Whatever i did't recommande this hostel, but i'm still recommande the others generaror hostel like Berlin or Barcelona.",Date of stay: January 2014,2.0

And for the most part, it really is. Nice reception, nice lounge etc. However, my room is a tiny 8 bed dorm in the bottom floor which feels like a dungeon. I don't think they ever clean the rooms - or if they do, it is poorly done/not done frequently enough. I have stayed here for over a week and all they appear to have done is change the bin liners. The showers have very little privacy and it is disgusting when the dirty water from the next shower cubicle runs through your cubicle. Most of the toilets don't flush properly and smell a bit, not to mention that when you enter the cubicle, you are usually greeted with the last person/people's ""remains"". Half the toilet doors don't lock properly -…",Date of stay: January 2014,2.0

As long as you're not expecting 5 star amenities then you'll be happy. Everything is clean and there are the basic facilities that you'd expect.  I stayed here in an 8-bed female only dorm and I was travelling alone. The thing that made me fall in love with this place, and ultimately have the most enjoyable week of my life were the staff and the people that I met.   There is a licensed bar / mini nightclub on the premises and there staff do an amazing job of getting everyone to mingle and have a great time.   The bathrooms could definitely do with an update.",Date of stay: June 2013,5.0

I've been traveling alot around the word, seen many diferent Hostels, Hotels... Only thing I can say about Generator is by far the best Hostel I've ever stayed in and even better then some hotels. For the price you got alot more then you expect. Rooms are clean and tidy, big, bright. You can ask  reception to change your bedding if needed and they will do it with a smile. I've been here 2 weeks and never had a single problem. Security are very polite and I think the security in this hostel is just on TOP. For the price they provide also cinema which is just unbelievable. You also got nice bar where u can have a drink listening to DJ every night.

I stayed in a 8-bed mixed dorm (part of the winter wipeout deal) for two nights in January.  The rooms were clean and nicely decorated and fairly comfortable.  Tons of common areas where you can talk to other travelers, charge electronics, grab a bite to eat, etc.  Great central location and lots of restaurants and sights around that are in walking distance.  I felt safe and secure in my room and in the hostel at all times, which to me is really the most important thing I consider when looking for a place to stay on a budget.   I had stayed in Generator Venice previously, which was AWESOME so I had high expectations, but overall I had a good experience and would stay there again.

They told me to wait till 2 until I could check- in, which was fine but as I approached reception at 2, they told me they couldn't find my booking and were in process of sending me elsewhere. I was very unimpressed but they eventually found a room. ultimately, I was put in a 8 bed dorm instead of a 6 bed dorm  but by then I didn't care. It was fortunate that the location was good and the staff were pretty friendly. They did end up reimbursing for the loss I accrued so that was nice.",Date of stay: July 2013,4.0

We were fourteen people in our room, which were in the basement. We couldn't open any windows and the aircondition wasn't working. Most of us complained on a daily basis seeing we were on a course and all had to stay there for four weeks. It was simply too hot and waking up drenched in your own sweat every morning was uncomfortable. After almost two weeks of complaining we got split into different rooms which were much better.  We also had problems with the boxes under the beds. The locks were broken so we couldn't lock them. We complained about this a lot too and even though they said they would fix it, it didn't really happen before they a new manager started, but then things started to happen.

The security is good as there is a guard on the main entrance 24 hours checking for your room key to make sure you are staying there before letting you enter. I love the common area, the small cinema hall, cafe and bar is just great. The hostel itself is very clean even though for me that I have a little cleanliness obsession.  A little complain from me is as I was staying in the lower ground, it feels a bit dodgy. Also, the common shower rooms are a little bit too few for the number of room in one level. The last thing is they let people check in at almost every hour. I remember one night waking up seeing someone just bring their luggage in so it is kind of scary.",Date of stay: December 2013,5.0
