The room stank of sweaty ulcerated feet and I was made to sleep in there as there were no other rooms available! Disgusting! The receptionist didn’t see a problem with the room!  The curtains were falling down and the pillows were awful! I finally moved rooms the following day, and the curtains still let light in and the pillows were awful!

I didn’t notice at first it was only when i was sitting on the bed to watch tv and I noticed the bed was sliding then the bed gave way and i fell down the back and injured myself. I went down to reception to explain what had happened. And was kept on being told i need id i need id. I kept explaining I don’t have anything. Then i was told to step aside so he could check other people in. Eventually a staff member came to my room to look at the bed and was trying to shove me in to a small room with my children saying that there fully booked. Im quite loyal to premier inn but on this occasion based on the staff attitudes and the fact the hotel is a health and safety risk i will never stay here ever again. I have pictures to prove the broken bed and may take legal action due to the injuries i have sustained.…,Date of stay: June 2021,1.0

All nicely served and at a good price. Compared to many places food at the Premier Inn is ‘good honest fayre at reasonable prices’. My only comment is that I don’t drink lager style beers as they often are too cold and lack taste.

I have since discovered the other side of the hotel would have been quieter, as the traffic noise from the road side is quite loud. At other Premier Inns there is additional soundproofing to mitigate against this problem, but this is not present at Woolwich!  There was also thudding noises from the room above around 0330. Not the hotel's fault, admittedly, but again I have to question the soundproofing. The hotel's number on the website did not work. The next morning I was told it was wrong and given the correct number (02030042236). The website still has an 0871 number, which still does not appear to work.

Helpful staff,"We stayed here for 1 night, during the first week of the hotel opening.  Room quality was great, and standard for modern Premier Inns.  Hotel had on sight parking, charged at £1 per hour, but capped at £12 for 24, which is not bad for London!  Staff were welcoming and very helpful.  Informative but not pushy!  Hotel was less than 5 mins walk from Woolwich centre and only 25 mins (direct bus) to the O2. ",Date of stay: August 2017,5.0

The room is tiny and not like pictures, we had a shower unit when the pictures showed a bath tub.   Then we went to our room and went to sleep and we get a knock on the door ""room service"" we shouted out no thanks and the guy still opened the door and i shouted again no till he said sorry and closed the door.   5 minutes later we get another knock and i said no, the manager opened the door and walked in!
