Even though it's called Tower Bridge, it's not really Tower Bridge, more the back of the Minories, so not a particularly nice area.  There is a Wetherspoon's next door though!  The main entrance is under construction, so you have to enter by a side door.  The hotel looks nice as you walk through, with lots of comfortable seating.  The restaurant, although we didn't use it, looks large and rather bland with lots of open seating.  The check in system was efficient. The hotel was full and social distancing was impossible, especially in the lifts.  This I found uncomfortable.  The room was clean and that was important to me, especially in this COVID world.  There was no evidence of people cleaning in public areas, as you see in other public places, but everything looked ok. There were no temperature checks in the spa area, as at my own health club.  And the pool was rather crowded and too many people to access the jacuzzi, steam room and sauna.  I was surprised that there was a cracked mirror on the wall - thought that this would have been a priority for housekeeping.  Nice that they provide shampoo etc. in small containers.  It's ok but nothing special and I probably won't return here.…",Date of stay: June 2021,3.0

Can't wait to go back already :),"I stayed in the executive room and the views were absolutely incredible, I could see the Shard and the Gherkin from my room! I had a sofa, desk and a massive bed - it really was like my own little penthouse! It was honestly an amazing time of pure luxury and relaxation. From the spa facilities (sauna, steam room, Jacuzzi and large heated pool) to the breakfast buffet- I honestly felt like I had been an a holiday abroad when staying at the Leonardo Tower Bridge. Everything about the hotel screams premium and luxury - for the price this is by far one of the best hotels in London. From the soft hotel bed sheets, free glass bottled water, lobby area (which is great to work in!) and of course the amazing spa and gym facilities.  I would like to make a special mention and thank you to Samir, the hotel manager, for going the extra mile - nothing was too much to ask! Outstanding hospitality, I can’t say enough thank yous! I can’t wait to go back for my fourth visit! Thank you Leonardo Tower Bridge! <3…",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

This was down to Samir, a fantastic employee of the hotel. The rooms, the location, the view (on the high floors) are great.   I called before arriving to request a room with a great view, ideally the Shard, the Gerkin and Tower bridge. I had stayed previously in this hotel and always loved it. Samir asked me to find him when I arrived, and he was so welcoming and patient with me. I was very happy with the room he offered. It had amazing views!   Throughout our holiday Samir continued to check on us, making sure we were happy. He couldn’t do enough for us! He is such an asset to the hotel, they should be honoured to have him. I wish every hotel had a Samir! What a great man he is.   The breakfast was very good. There was a member of staff serving the hot buffet, which made it clean and hygienic. There was also a good selection of healthy options which I really enjoyed, and the seating area is much smarter than when it was The Grange.   I’m already looking forward to being back, and I will certainly contact Samir before coming again. Thank you!…",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

We were on the 2nd floor so obviously the view isn't as good as what you can see from 10th floor but still nice to see London at night.

The details you’d expect from a mid to high-end hotel just weren’t up to scratch. Lack of amenities – bring your own toothbrush/tooth paste if you plan on staying here.

This was frustrating as the Spa was a main part of my break. Upon arrival to the hotel I asked to speak to the manager (Marcin Czekaj) who was extremely understanding and accommodating.

The hotel is fine - it needs updating, the carpets are so worn that they’re threadbare in some rooms and smell quite strongly. However the rub comes from the company deleting all their guest’s points when Jurys Inn took over earlier in 2019 and didn’t tell scheme members. I’d managed to save 20,000 points so had enough cash for one free night in London but then in April was advised all my points had gone and I had to email their customer relations team. This was after spending probably £10 grand over two years!  I emailed guest relations and was advised that they would be back in touch, and guess what?! They never got back in touch.

My only grumble was that they did not provide dressing gowns and slippers in the room for use in the spa - which they used to when it was a Grange hotel.
