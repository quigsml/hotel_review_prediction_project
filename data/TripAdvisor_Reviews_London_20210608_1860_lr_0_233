The only redeeming feature was the staff at reception who were pleasant and helpful.    I didn't feel safe at all in the hostel. Firstly, it felt like everyone who was staying there was living there. It was an extremely weird vibe, and not at all like other hostel experiences I have had where you can meet other travellers. Everyone I spoke to had been there weeks, there were definitely some dodgy characters - one woman who shouted at me in the kitchen for no reason and I learnt had had other unpleasant encounters with other people in the hostel. I definitely didn't feel safe here and it was unnerving that the hostel didn't do anything about these situations.   The hostel kitchen was ill-equipped and only had one fridge which was absolutely jam-packed with carrier bags full of everyone's food. There wasn't enough cutlery for people to eat at the same time and it felt dirty.   The room was tiny for the number of people, the lockers were broken and falling off the hinges. The bed was hard and uncomfortable that I woke up with a cricked neck. There were, however, curtains on each bed for privacy and a plug socket which is handy.   The location is good as it is just around the corner from Camden Town and Mornington Cresent tube stations and on the same street as some good bus routes. However, it was also very dodgy - did not feel safe going out onto the street, but also my room looked out onto the street and hostel guests would sit on the front steps chatting loudly and smoking with receptionists too.…",Date of stay: September 2020,1.0

A great point is the private bathroom in the room, even if very small, it is very confortable. Otherwise I think the rooms are too small for 6 people and there is not enough space for your staff.

The room in general barely fits one person, let alone 4, luckily enough I basically got it all for myself during those 2 days, and forget about no noise, everyone is in the common areas at any time of the day or the night talking, no one cares about the ""please be respectful"" rule, and the thin walls of the room don't help at all.

The windows had bars over them and we couldn't open them properly to let the smell out. I didn't bother with breakfast either because it was so poor.
