Great location.,"We are stunned how good the staff is in this hotel, especially I would like to praise Christina (reception). She went above and beyond to meet our needs. We were coming with our 2yr daughter for treatment at Portland hospital so Holiday Inn is ideal for us.  My wife called day before to the hotel. I've called pre arrival and Christina answered the phone on both occasions, after explaining our situation we requested early c/in and late c/out, both requests were accepted and check out extended even longer. Amazing!!! I cannot be more thankful for this!  When we arrived Christina has greeted us with a smile (our daughter liked her) and swiftly proceeded with easy check in. We were offered room service, but had to refuse due to allergies, however Christina mentioned that she could speak to the chef and they can accommodate our food request - another star for this!   I have worked in 5* Hotel for nearly 10 years and could only tell that Christina is a 5* receptionist! Management should be proud of having this person in their team   Clean rooms in general.

It's well situated and has a really neat lobby and dinning area, however, when you get to the room you find it adequately small. It does the job but it's pretty small. I call it a one step bathroom. It only takes one small step from the bathroom door to the toilet and that's not a big step either. It can be a little expensive but then you're paying for the location.

And the room itself on the 6th floor was excellent. Recently refurbished so everything was new feeling. Slight downside was that the aircon was a little bit uncontrollable but not a big issue.

My only gripe was that as I was being checked into a twin room as the hotel was ""fully booked"" another guest was being offered a choice of rooms and an upgrade. This didn't seem very equitable to me.  The room was small and the two separate beds made moving around the room awkward. However, it was adequate.   The shower was particularly weedy, particularly noticeable when trying to get the temperature up meant bringing the flow rate down to a near trickle!

In general this is all being done nicely, but one is bound to wonder ablot two things.  a) Why not replace bathroom doors that are split and have nails poking out, rather than paint them?  b) Some of the grouting seems to have been done by someone who has not been trained or supervsied, as there is grout almost everywhere except where it should be.

I booked through my airline so I got a very good rate, which included breakfast. I must say that after staying two nights in a 4 star London hotel on the start of the trip and 4 nights in Glasgow 4 star hotel for a conference, I wasn't expecting much and the Holiday Inn delivered way above my expectations. I was very ill with a respiratory infection when I arrived. The concierge, who told me he had been through many many changes at the hotel, was just divine and so helpful. The rooms are small but just the same at other London hotels, costing much more. The beds, duvets, and pillows are wonderful. I thought…",Date of stay: January 2004,4.0

I booked my stay through the airline so I got a good deal. The hotel is in a nice area, close to Regent's Park and two tube stations.  There are a number of small resturants and grocery stores near..so you can save on meals. Yes, the rooms are on the small side but they are clean and very nice. I would have, in fact, gave it a higher rating if the rooms had be a little bigger. I was not dissappointed at all. I don't understand the one star review one person gave.",Date of stay: February 2004,3.0

The location could be better but hey, its only a few minute walk to the tube (underground) and theres restaurants, shops, a pub and a mini supermarket. The rooms i thought were quite well maintained, the furniture looked in good condition and the pillows, beds and covers were all clean and comfy. The only downside to the room was that the bathroom was small, only enough room for one but it was clean and tidy.  I never ate in the restaurant or drank in the bar as i knew what the prices would be like. Eating in hotels aree always more expensive anyway, but in London i knew it would be dearer still so i avoided it.  The room service, which is 24hrs had a wide selection but some items looked a bit pricey.…",None,4.0

There wasn't a selection for ""good, but not great,"" which is what I would have liked three dots to signify.)  I've stayed in a few properties in London and all over Britain as a visitor. I stayed in the Holiday Inn London Regent's Park mid-January of this year with a companion.  It's hard to give an overall score, as the hotel varied in quality and value in many areas. Here are my thoughts on a few important points of consideration.  Location: Less than a five minute walk from the Great Portland Street Underground station. Near the Underground stop, you have two markets (more like convenience stores to all you fellow Americans), a pub, a cafe (one Pret-a-Manger and the other…",None,4.0

Try Marriott or Hilton!,"Very disappointed with this Hotel & Company. There is no way this hotel deserves 4 stars. Rooms are tiny (I had upgraded to and Executive & was told to expect a larger room, but it was the same size as a standard room just with ""extras""). Bathrooms are really small. Furinture in room dirty & worn. Showerhead covered in mildew. Bad traffic noise. Office chairs used in the bedrooms. Breakfast items were sometimes cold. Staff unwilling to help at all. I will not be using this company again. I expected a lot more from this chain, but I am extremely let down.Good location, but then so are most hotels in London as they are all more or less next door to tube stations!",None,1.0

(January 2004) HotelÂ s spot is very near to the tube and Oxford Street.Frankly speaking, Hotel was far better than my expectations. And to me, absolutely far better than many other hotels in London in this price range. Rooms were very clean, modern and warmly decorated. I enjoyed the breakfast a lot. It was excellent. Staff in the breakfast room was wonderful.My only negative observation was referring to reception staff. Maybe I can kindly put into this way. They were not generous enough in terms of using the words! When you need to ask them questions, you may ask, but the answers are very very limited!On the other hand, English guy (in his late fifties, with eye-glasses) at concierge…",None,5.0

I have stayed at several other hotels in London (most of which were old, dirty, and in bad locations)....Holiday Inn Regents Park far surpasses them. It is located in a nice mid-upper class neighborhood and is just a block away from the Great Portland St. tube stop on 2 different subway lines. The rooms are modern with comfortable pillows and duvets. The bathrooms are nice and clean. The room was a little cramped but for the price, location, and amenities...it was quickly overlooked!I will definitely stay here again!",None,5.0
