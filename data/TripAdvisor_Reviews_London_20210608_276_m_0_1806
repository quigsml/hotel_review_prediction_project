We had a family weekend stay and couldn’t be happier with the hotel.   Room had all the amenities we could want. Safe, Water, Iron etc.   View of Grosvenor Square was really nice.   Beds were fantastic and gave us a good nights sleep after a lot of walking.   All the front desk staff went above and beyond. Bruno who checked us in was polite, attentive and very helpful. Leena who checked us out was also very helpful and started the process of finding our baby daughters handbag. Which thankfully we found.   Finally Francis director or sales and marketing. Who introduced himself and was happy to hear my feedback and answer any of my questions. Class.   All round a fantastic stay.

Pros:- Perfectly located for Bond Street.   Very friendly and helpful staff throughout.   Our executive room was a good size with nice walk-in shower and a view of the inner courtyard (if you are going to book a courtyard view try to get one of the rooms with a balcony…provided you don’t mind all the other rooms overlooking you!).   The adjoining Gordon Ramsey grill was pretty good (but not outstanding by any stretch). Breakfast was included and was table service only due to COVID restrictions. This actually worked very well and the quality of the breakfast was very good.   Cons:- Our room was not as clean as it should have been. For example, the shower had not been dried down as there was still water in the tray, and the coffee table was stained with what looked like glue or clear nail vanish.   Other small gripes were the lack of any tissues (fairly standard in every hotel of 4 star and above), no Nespresso machine (only basic tea & coffee facilities), weighing scales which did not work (batteries?), and probably worst of all the air con unit which blowed an absolute gale regardless of the fan setting (we had to keep it switched-off).

Scrambling to get my son to London and rearrange flights to get home was frustrating but at the Marriott, all it took was one conversation with the front desk to have put stay extended, a pull out put in my room for my son and assurances that the hotel would work to help us with any problems.

It's location is superb--within a short walk of much of the vibrant Mayfair, Oxford Street and Piccadilly shopping areas, the tube, and with many fine restaurants nearby. We have always found service to be correct and friendly, and the fact that there are two Gordon Ramsey restaurants in the hotel, and that is has what we think is one of the best Executive Lounge breakfasts in the Marriott system, simply adds to the attraction. Although rooms tend to be on the small side (even for London) they are well appointed and attractive with good functionality for Americans.

Decor was uniquely traditional but Modern.  Food at the hotel restaurant was good. There is also a great little bar in the hotel a great pub next door and a few cafes across the road.  For travelling business people there is a gym packed with modern life fitness gear but the height of the roof in the gym is very low and when busy makes it feel claustrophobic.

Decent Hotel,"Stayed for 5 nights on a business trip.   Pros:  Great location around the corner from U.S. embassy and Hyde Park.  Rooms were small (though average for London) but well equipped. Gym was serviceable.  service was very good and friendly. Cons:  Hotel is small with narrow hallways.  Elevators were AWFUL, slow and unreliable. breakfast was limited but expensive (cheaper/better options up the street).  Would absolutely stay here again and would recommend for business travel.  If traveling for banks/finance, would caution that it is somewhat distant from City and Canary Wharf.",Date of stay: September 2014,4.0

It is very near the major shopping areas, three blocks from the Bond Street tube stop, has a small convenience store across the street and has comfortable rooms.  The restauarant is very expensive but there are several good spots nearby for dinner or a drink. If you want a solid hotel with no surprises in an unbeatable but quiet location, this is the spot. (My only better option is the currently closed for renovation hotel The Mayfair Intercontinental.)",None,3.0

While I didn't use the exercise room, we were on the executive floor, and the room where they served breakfast (and we watched World Cup games on TV, relaxed, read the paper, etc.) was lovely, with very nice staff. Our room was extra large, with quite nice furnishings, and a very good bathroom. Also, the walk to the tube is, I think, 3 blocks.",Date of stay: July 2002,4.0

Hotel is conveniently located; however, unless you take a taxi, it's several minutes to the tube.  Exercise room is third world; unfortunately the ""usual"" for many hotels these days, a room in the corner with a few pieces of outdated and in need of refurbishment cardio equipment.  Full breakfast included with Executive Level room.  Room amenities are good and service falls into ""good/excelllent"" category. ",None,3.0
