I called Abe’s today at 11:59 for 4 wings and a side of curly fries. Was told at the time of call it would take 20 minutes. Okay fine. I arrive, I pay, I wait. Then I go to check on my order, and am told by who is working the register that my order will be out and done at 12:29. So with that, and with the trying times going on, I have 30 minutes lunch, I work in healthcare. Already had a stressful day, I am starving, can’t wait to try Abe’s for the first time. But being I only had a 30 minute lunch I had 20 to spare/wait and 10 to eat. So naturally I went ahead and canceled my order because I wanted to be able to eat something before I clock back in. As my order is canceled my food comes out. Mind you nowhere near 12:29. So not only is it poor communication amongst staff but frankly the manager just didn’t care. When I call back to ask when my refund will be issued I had the displeasure of speaking with DENISE, who says “you really couldn’t wait one minute”. That was the cherry on top. Not only did she not care, I don’t even recall an apology from her. Yes I yelled and cussed at her. But again I work in healthcare, it is very stressful and I was very hungry. Don’t let Abe’s fool you, the word “friend” is splashed all over the website but I would never be friends with a woman like Denise who can’t show new customers common courtesy. You may have good reviews and good food, but that is nothing without a good heart. Didn’t even offer me anything for my wasted time and her rudeness. I will be telling all of my coworkers and providers who cater from Abe’s about my experience today, you lost business today. Congrats. First and last time ever going to Abe’s.

If you read my other reviews from around the world you will see I am fair and try to see the silver linings. That was not possible with this  ""hotel"".  When we first arrived we waited in a cue of people leaving there left luggage to check in. These people probably thought would be secure but the hotel is far from secure. This can be seen in the picture of the wedged open fire escape. Couldn't get a picture of the reception desk was too cramped and rarely manned.  When we entered the room we were shocked. The smell of mould, was overpowering. We opened the window further it looked into a flat roof and alley. Outside the window we found needles and syringes. We went and told the desk this. The reply was ""we cant be responsible for what people do in our rooms"". Another problem was the lack of light in the room. They had to replace the dud bulbs. I will be honest the room was en suite but seemed more like a converted office or something similar. The pictures on trip advisor and there website are at best deceiving and worst a lie.   We were concerned for our security as outside the hotel wasn't the best. The window and loose lock on the door were an issue. The window was sorted by the desk staff jamming window closed and the door he said was ""PERFECTLY SECURE"" and assured that the desk was manned 24 hrs. This was not the case and even if was the fire exit open to our door negated that.  The breakfast was sparse. The bread left out for toast was hard and as sitting there they started to use the eating area for their luggage business. I feel sorry for people who think there luggage is secure.   We had a full itinerary so luckily only spent a few hours in the room at night. We only had to bare the smell at that time. Due to the security issues we kept all valuables with us and when in room kept a chair against the door. Two nights was the maximum we could manage.  As I have said we tried to speak with management. We were told there was nothing wrong and nothing they could do. Speaking with other residents found they had similar issues.  I WOULD WARN ANYONE TO AVOID THIS PLACE. At one point I did consider contacting environmental health. If had been a longer stay there.  Included are pictures of all the doors wedged open. The fire door open to the main road with no one their. The picture of syringe outside window. The needle didn't show up as was further down.…",Date of stay: September 2019,1.0

After a fumbling check in I was directed to my room, once I’d managed to negotiate the maze of narrow stairs, corridors and doors I finally found my room at the very top of the building. (Room 11). I had been told this was second floor but was actually third.   Upon opening the heavy auto close door, as far as it would open with the chair pushed behind it and forcing my luggage into my room I was initially presented with a pleasant enough room. But that didn’t last long.  The room is very compact and I wouldn’t like to think I’d had to share and fight my way around with a partner. There are only 2 plugs in the room, and if you want to use the fan or the heater you are reduced to a single plug to use. Everything needs some TLC, from the scraped and holed walls, the tiny TV with a remote that bends as you press a button.  The ‘body’ towels were small and the bathroom was filthy.   If it wasn’t for my 11pm arrival I’d have turned around and found somewhere else.  Bedding wasn’t clean, and I slept on top of the duvet on two very flat pillows.

It is in a good location, true, but the bathroom (in our private room) smelled terrible and wasn't cleaned properly before we got there, the staircase to our room was barely manageable with luggage, and the whole place generally felt unclean and smelled vaguely unpleasant.

Located a few blocks from the Victoria Train/Tube Station with many local restaurants nearby. Our room was small but comfortable. Our bathroom tiles needed to be replaced and it was difficuly getting in and out of the shower since the bath tub & shower were combined. Getting out was especially difficult. The hotel employees were friendly and very helpful. We asked for an early arrival room but were not accomodated until 4 PM.  The Bellman stored our luggage until our room was ready. There was free internet in the room.,Date of stay: June 2012,4.0

The hotel is cheap for the location (near Victoria Station) and I found the breakfast quite good for the price of the hotel. The rooms are small and rather 'worn' and the bathroom was shared and very small. But it is convenient for one or two nights and I would stay there again if needed (altho my girlfriend would not).",Date of stay: August 2009,3.0

Despite checking with 10-12 hotels, this one was the only one with availability. So... now that you have the background...here are the pros and cons:  PROS 1. Cheap - we paid 40 pounds for our room.  2. Location- next door to Victoria station, as the name suggests.  3. Free breakfast with the room - nothing fancy, eggs and cereal 4. Receptionist/owner- we found him very helpful  CONS 1. Rooms - ours was tiny, and there were two double bed instead of one king.  2. No en suite bathroom.  3. General dilapidation of the place.   Overall, this place is run down, small, rickety and true, on its last leg. However it should be said -- there were not bed bugs…",Date of stay: October 2008,3.0
