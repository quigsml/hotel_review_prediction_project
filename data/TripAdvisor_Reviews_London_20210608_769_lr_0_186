The thing that struck me was how clean it was .. the location is brilliant . I have mobility issues and they gave us a ground floor room as requested .  The room was very small but was ok for 1 night ..  although the bathroom was absolutely tiny and my 6ft 5 hubby found it a struggle !! The staff were friendly and accommodating . The breakfast room was down a couple of flights of stairs but they did say my hubby could go and get my breakfast and bring it to our room .  Breakfast was cereal toast tea coffee and juice. . It was ok for  a free breakfast . The breakfast room was really clean and tidy  We would stay here again ,Date of stay: March 2020,3.0

The en-suite ‘facilities’ consisted of a small moulded plastic area which was so small  you could sit on the toilet and wash in the basin at the same time. If like me you are a larger lady don’t try and bend in the shower as it’s impossible. Whilst the bed linen was clean the sink plug was full of grime and the door had never been wiped. In another room there was significant mould on the shower curtain dirty walls, stained mattress and fist holes in doors. In addition you could not open doors at the same time, the curtains were full of mould and were filthy. When you looked out the window you had a view of the rubbish store and fag butts. Things did not get better when we went for the inclusive  continental breakfast. This comprised of two loaves of bread by two toasters to which you helped yourself and butter and jam. The instant coffee was a mixture of two brands in a jar serviced by a water boiler.  There were not enough tables and chairs for all the guests who had to have breakfast during one hour period from 9am to 10am. This property is budget, budget however a sign in reception offered a one night stay at £149 for a single room with £199 double. Absolutely overpriced. Whilst the location is ideal for Victoria Station there are plenty of alternative hotels, I wish we had used one.…",Date of stay: November 2019,2.0

I didn't read the Trip Adviser reviews until after I had booked.  The whole hotel is rather dated, but I was shown to my room, which was a single, small, but perfectly adequate for just me. I had a look in the 'bathroom', which was a sort of module. There was no plug in the washbasin, making it difficult to wash. Then I checked out the toothmug... it was filthy. Nobody would want to use it. The tiny TV was 'interesting' to watch because the picture was all wrong, sort of negative. I had been warned that the heating wouldn't go on till 5pm and go off at midnight, hence, as it was a cold night, I was cold. An electric heater had been offered, but at midnight I wasn't about to pad out to Reception to ask for one. The Receptionist was at pains to show me the list for breakfast: Tea or Coffee (instant), brown or white bread to toast yourself, two kinds of jam sachets, honey, butter, cornflakes and high fibre flakes. The dining room is down steep stairs in the basement, which is impossible for disabled guests. It was advertised as a Continental breakfast. Surely that would include croissants, fresh rolls and real coffee? Chipped  crockery didn't go down well with the guests, either. Also, breakfast was only from 8 - 9, which meant that if you had an early start for business meetings, you had no chance. The washing up was being done by hand and rubbish bags were both there and in the hallway where we could leave out luggage as we had to check out by 10am. But the most dangerous and illegal thing about staying there was that the fire doors, which of course should be kept closed apart from the odd time, though they were all closed when I arrived and was shown to my room, when I started out for dinner, they were all held back by permanent hooks, which had been fitted for the purpose. I subsequently closed the one leading to my room. When I asked the night receptionist about it, he told me to ask after 9am in the morning. I did, and the daytime receptionist didn't know that they were shut, he claimed.…",Date of stay: November 2019,1.0
