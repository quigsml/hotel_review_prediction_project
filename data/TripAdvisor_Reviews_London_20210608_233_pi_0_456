There’s so many problems I don’t know where to start.  DONT TAKE KIDS You feel so unsafe at this hotel. As I was entering there was 2 young men arguing in the reception area.  As we got to our room it was very nice however the blankets and bedding was stained didn’t feel comfortable sleeping in it and the staff wouldn’t change it. We order some food from the hotel restaurant for 2 meals came over £60!! And the food and service was disgusting. As I went down to collect it I had to call my partner down because they were no help. As we were going to bed we only had a pillow each and the bed was so hard to sleep on it gave us a really bad back the next day and I also asked for 2 more pillows after waiting an hour at 1 am. They arrived with one pillow case stuffed with material. How very poor. Someone on our floor (5) was having a party all night and the stink of weed so so bad it makes you feel sick. We had to be up early the next day for work it was impossible to sleep. My partner smokes and he didn’t feel safe going outside for a cigarette. And we both was so thirty all night. They do not sell any drinks past 9pm and no shops around to buy any. It’s so disgusting here would never go again. …,Date of stay: June 2021,1.0

Where the hotel falls down at the moment is being so under staffed, the team led by Terri are very helpful and pleasant and are in general a credit to Premier Inn,  however they desperately need help especially at breakfast   where with no current unlimited breakfast despite being advertised by the chain it is a longish wait for it to be cooked, 20 mins minimum and can take up to an hour, I would have no hesitation in staying again but you would be doing them a favour by missing out breakfast.

I'm not one to write reviews but this was needed. Well, sadly, our first time back since lockdown restrictions lifted, we stayed here for three nights to celebrate my birthday, standards have seriously taken a hit. Very understaffed, probably trying to save money by putting little to no staff working, we saw a employee crying being shouted at by other customers because she did not have any more seating to offer, the employees having to run around on reception and resturant. It was clear they were unable to meet demands, due to lack of staff. Luckily, we were refunded for breakfast, we paid for a Premier Breakfast (£8.99 each) We have plans on coming to London again in November, but it's making me think twice about whether or not to book here, which is ashame because we are very familiar with Sarah, Josephine and Terry who went above and beyond for us, even for customers who gave them a hard time. We didn't get everything we asked for, but given the circumstance, we don't hold them accountable. On a positive note, the location is just so convenient.

I chose it for the location as it's across from a good-sized mall and minutes away from an Ikea and super Tesco where I could find most everything my son would need to get settled into his dorm. In addition, I felt it would be helpful to be a short walk from a major transportation center where I could catch a bus or ride the tube to anywhere needed. Lastly, I knew it would be helpful to stay at a hotel with breakfast and dinner service, which this one had. This hotel had all of that and more. First - the exceptional service.

We received our key and on entering our room we discovered we had been placed in a disabled room.  Whilst the room was obviously spacious, the shower contained a fold up seat which made showering difficult.  When we asked reception about the room they said it was all the had left.  We had booked over a week earlier so we found that hard to believe.

I already checked in on their website so check in in the hotel took approx. 30 seconds. Hotel is still rather new, rooms were of an ok size....everything is there , no complaints ! We took the extended breakfast (instead of continental) and that was a good choice (eggs, bacon and more warm things) the best thing about the hotel is its location.  It is approx. 300 meters away of the subway/train/bus station.  Perfect for arriving : take the stansted express and it stops almost in front of your door.... so easy ! In the morning you have to take the underground and 15 min later you're in the center of london....
