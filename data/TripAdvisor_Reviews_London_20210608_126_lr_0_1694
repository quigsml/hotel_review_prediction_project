He was very caring, catered to all our needs and went the extra mile to assist us in every way. The amount of professionalism, charisma he has shown has left us an excellent impression and we will definitely be coming back more often.

Certainly, with this location, I was missing a treat. I checked in around 9pm and was informed by the incredibly courteous receptionist that I had been upgraded, which was much appreciated after the long day. The room was spotless and came with the vast majority of pre-covid amenities, including the Nespresso machine, as well as a beautifully hot rain shower which was also much required after a long day of travelling. For the ¬£72 paid for the night, just a day before visiting, I'd say that the value for money in terms of being right on Paddington's doorstep is nigh on unbeatable. ",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

I had booked an executive type king room with a complimentary bottle of wine of my choice. On arrival the staff were polite but seemed more concerned in me leaving a review than dealing with my requirements. How can this be even discussed when you have not seen the room, facilities etc.  But, anyway after going to my room and dropping bags I returned to reception and I asked if I could amend my booking to overnight. They charged a ¬£15 extra fee which was reasonable and also took a ¬£25 fee which I get back on leaving ????? I then asked about the wine, a lady asked me if it was shown in my booking to which I replied ""yes"" she asked what type of wine red or white. I replied ""white"".  A few hours later another lady brings me a small bottle of Rose and explained to me that is all they had. I tasted it and simply poured down the sink. This made me turn from medium happy to unhappy.  The next morning I went down for breakfast, the guy asked me if I had a voucher from hotel, I never and they never mentioned this to me on check in either. I said I can pay with visa, looked at menu and prices and it was shocking. ¬£2.35 for a glass or orange. So I walked out,  and I explained to hotel reception this was disgusting.  No mention of breakfast when checking in and I also explained I am an accor diamond member. So far in this calender year I have already 138 stays. This obviously counts for nothing.  I would look for accommodation elsewhere, there has to be better than this.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: May 2021,2.0

After a 10 minute walk, I arrived, sodden, windswept and fed up. I explained to the receptionist what happened and she shrugged. No apology, no sympathy- really poor service.

You're having a laugh,"I guess they'll say - what do you expect for a London hotel. Well, I'll tell you - I expect a room where I don't have to shuffle in the door and round the bed because the room is so small. I also expect to be able to fully open the wardrobe doors rather than have them foul the bedside cabinet and bed. At best my double room should be a single but even then it's not long enough. I'm 6ft 4 and slept at a diagonal in a too small double bed. Taxi had trouble to find the hotel too - the entrance is best described as discrete. I stayed there as the Heathrow Express is 2 minutes walk - if that's your priority then fine but there must be better options than this.",Date of stay: June 2015,2.0

I stay regularly in this hotel for convenience (close to paddington) but it just isn't a good hotel. Sure staff is friendly, but management and maintenance is poor. Some rooms are quite noisy and windows don't close well (they put complimentary earplugs next to the bed, so that gives you a good hint).   This week my shower did not work, which obviously is quite annoying if you find out at 7am and you are pressed for time.   What triggered me to share this is that I left my email/phone number as obviously it is not acceptable that a shower doesn't work in a 200¬£/night room, but to date no one contacted me.

In London I was initially supposed to stay in hotel appartments called Assaha, close to Lancaster Gate tube station. When we got there we were so scared of conditions, we started to research for any alternative. Walking arroung we found Mercure Paddington, and right away we got there and asked for free room for 3 people (2 adults and teenager). Even though family rooms were not available we got a executive room with huge double bed, that easily and comfortably accomodated all 3 of us. We moved to Mercure after 30 minutes and we enjoyed our stay for next 4 days. Mercure rooms are so clean and well planned, that even in small space everything needed is available.

This was uncomfortable as a couple as one person sleeps in the crack. 2) Asking for a taxi from the front desk is a scam, and be sure to ask for an official taxi or just walk outside and look around. In my case, the front desk called a taxi for me and an unmarked car turns up. I see the driver give a 2-3 pound tip to the front desk, then I was charged 22 pounds for a 11 pound taxi ride.
