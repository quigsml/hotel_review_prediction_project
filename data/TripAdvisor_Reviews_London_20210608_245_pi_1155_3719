Earl's Court tube stop was an easy walk, even with luggage.   The tube easily  took us everywhere we wanted visit.  Every evening it was great to return to the comfort of the Premier Inn. The hotel offered breakfast and happy hour specials. Both were wonderful.  The rooms are quite small with little storage space but very comfortable, especially the bed.  The only suggestion we would  have is be very careful getting out of the bath.  It is very high and hand rails would have been a nice safety feature.  The comfort, location and price made this hotel one we'd surely return to.  ",Date of stay: July 2015,5.0

Ideal for the Chelsea Flower Show or indeed any other big events nearby.  Rooms have a very comfortable double bed with decent, supporting pillows. They are also en-suite with bath and shower, and towels are provided. Ask for a room at the back and you are free of London traffic noise.  You have to pay extra for breakfast but they do a reasonable meal deal which includes an evening meal and full English or continental breakfast.  The continental breakfast is actually substantial, so for the weight-conscious you don't have to starve yourself - the fresh berries and array of cerials and yoghurts were particularly welcome.

It is built literally over the tube line, so if you're unlucky enough to get a room positioned over or adjacent to the line, there is a ridiculous amount of noise. If you value the quiet which normally comes with a Premier Inn, please ask about this if you choose to book. When I went for breakfast after a disrupted night's stay, I was told that breakfast was not included in the room rate I had paid, even though I was able to produce a booking confirmation which clearly showed it was!! The staff refused to honour the breakfast booking because it didn't show up on 'their system', stating that the booking agent I used must've made a mistake.

Having stayed in several other Premier Inns without complaint we went for this one. Ground floor reception area was not very welcoming, however the staff were.

We found it very difficult to get the temperature of the room down to a comfortable level without opening the window. Knaresborough Place can be quite busy.

As other people have remarked, the staff should be proud of the service they give, they were so pleasant and helpful.  We weren't in the main building, but this suited us fine as it was very quiet across there.  The only complaint I have was that their site allows you to select a twin room, (they even show pictures of two single beds) however it's not made clear that one bed is the double and the other is the roll out bed used in family rooms.  Ironically I enquired last year at another Premier Inn location about a family room, but told that we couldn't book one because the roll out bed was not suitable for someone over 16.

To get to the exhibition halls it took about 20 minutes walking and just a few minutes by taxi (taxis cost about £8). To get there by taxi from London Euston was quite expensive, £22, so it might be worth checking out the tube connections.  The hotel is really nice, it has its own bar and Thyme restaurant.

The hotel is in a nice and safe area, quite close to Earl's Court underground station. The hotel is split in two buildings, connected by a covered corridor crossing Knaresborough. In the first building there is the entrance; its opposite side overlooks the underground trakcs. The second building is in front of the first one, very close to the Marriott. We booked a family room. These rooms are located in the second building. Being in four, an additional bed was added. For that reason large part of the room was occupied by the beds (one near the other, with basically no space between one and another).

Rooms were very clean and well air-conditioned, beds very comfortable and lots of hot water. The only thing that I would recommend is that you get a room well away from the area that the trains run, as two of our family group who had booked in earlier than us got a room on the first floor and it was difficult at times to sleep with the noise.

The staff were friendly, and the automated check in was quick and simple to use.  I think next time we go to an event at Earls Court we'll find a Premier Inn a little farther out, simply because the price of hotel in Central London is so high.

The breakfast was one of the best I have had (and I stay in hotels every week) as food was fresh and plentiful and the surroundings pleasant. Only one complaint, the one bed for one of my children was not very comfortable, no more than a mattress on the floor, but the others were great. The room was a little cramped for 4 but for only one night it was absolutely fine. Staff were friendly and I would recommend this for a budget short term stay for four.

Rather than pay, even though it was a nominal charge, we went to local pub and used their wifi for free.  Premier Inns needs to get with the times, and stop trying to nickel and dime their guests.

The room was typical Premier Inn - no real frills, but pretty much unbeatable for the price. My issues with it started to niggle more and more, though.   Secondly, the heating was adjustable, but it never seemed to work properly. So, if you increased it a little, it seemed to increase considerably and vice versa. It was always too hot or too cold!

The room was newly refurbished - or it seemed it - with a huge bed, flat screen tv, seating area, dressing table and a kettle etc.   The bathroom was bigger than mine at home, and was all new with a white suite and the shower was great, high enough for me which is a bonus as i am 6ft tall and in most hotel rooms the shower head only comes to my shoulders, which makes it hard…",Date of stay: June 2008,5.0

The hotel is very close to Earl's Court tube station, no more than a two minute walk along Earl's Court Gardens.  The rooms are lovely and big, with a desk, seating area and a reading lamp, in case guests want to have company visit or just sit and read.  The bed was comfortable, and I very much liked having extra pillows available (in the cupboard), rather than having to ask at Reception.  The shower was powerful, and a very pleasant extra was a nice big bath tub as well - a real treat.   Breakfast is optional, but there are a number of places to eat within a ten minute walk of the hotel, so that's not really a minus.

Check in was OK but the staff made my day when they were able to get me a non-smoking room, even though there were only smoking rooms available when I booked through Expedia.

Location was good, 5 minutes walk from Earls Court tube station.  The room was spacious, tidy and had air con which was a major plus considering the heat wave the weekend we went. Having stayed in other London hotels that don't have air con- this was a god send as rooms can get quite cooped up.  The only negative thing i would say about our stay is we turned up at 1.30pm, half hour before check in and we weren't able to get a room.  5 minutes later, another couple checked in after us and the woman who served them gave them a room.
