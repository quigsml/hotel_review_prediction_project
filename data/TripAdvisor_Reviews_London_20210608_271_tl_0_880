The window opens just a fraction, the fan's tiny and there's no air con (except for the bar/cafe). 2) IT'S NOISY The DLR is directly opposite and London City Airport on the other side of the dock. Therefore, with trains and planes passing every few minutes, there's more background noise than most people like, especially the planes which are quite loud.

Don't get me wrong, the rooms are functional, but you get what you pay for. In my case, it appears I paid for two security guards and a receptionist to barge into my room when my partner was in the shower, and I was naked, save for a towel around my waist. Apparently we'd been smoking in the room, and set the fire alarm off, but when challenged, the security guard said it could have been activated by the steam from the shower.   Never in my life have I paid for the privilege of being treated so poorly, so the remainder of my reservation has been cancelled and we'll be spending the rest of our time in London in a proper hotel.

However that's about all I can say in terms of things I found good about the hotel.  Firstly, when we arrived we were allocated a 2nd floor room. We got to the room and opened the door to find a confused man inside, who had gotten barged in on by us. They had given us an occupied room. How can this happen at a modern hotel? Surely they must keep a log of who is in the rooms? We went back to reception to complain yet didn't receive an apology, rather we were nonchalantly told we'd be given a different room.
