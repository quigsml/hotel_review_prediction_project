The front door is needlessly locked. Occupancy is so low I never saw another guest during a two night stay. Two paper cups and a wooden stirrer in the room, breakfast was a cereal bar, apple, yogurt and pastry. Nothing hot. Not even a hot drink. Absolutely disgraceful for a four star establishment and very damaging to the Hilton brand. I stayed at the Hilton Metropole nearby the week before and they managed to keep the foot door unlocked, keep the lights on, and offer a hot breakfast. When I complained at the Doubletree I was told that my feedback would be passed on - but no apology and my complaints were not addressed. This is an establishment trying to save money using the pandemic as an excuse. If the breakfast room cannot open, at least service a decent grab-and-go. This placed used it as an excuse for a cheap and nasty cost-saving opportunity.…",Date of stay: September 2020,1.0

A couple of days before our stay Hilton emailed us offering an upgrade as the always do, and as we hadn’t been away for a while we decided to accept booking a two floor suite. On arrival we checked in excited to see our upgraded room and how disappointed were we! Tiny seated area with no natural light, worn carpets and a wobbly staircase to the bedroom that looked across a roof top, the nicest part of the room was the bathroom! Completely out dated, dark and dingy, not the experience we expected.  As a Hilton Honours member so much more is expected we should have stayed in a standard room at the Amba across the road.…",Date of stay: September 2020,3.0

With COVID-19 protocol enforced,  we had already tempered our expectations of hotel stays, with reduced services available. When we arrived we had to ring the door bell to enter, a pleasant safety and COVID precaution for the hotel. We were greeted and checked in by Sardia, a lovely and wonderfully pleasant lady, who was very patient with us. She was extremely helpful in searching our Hilton Honours membership number which we had forgotten and inadvertently left our card at home. During the remainder of our stay, whenever Sardia was on duty she was very helpful and accommodating to us.

Easily the worst DoubleTree i've ever stayed at.  The front doors are inexplicably locked even during daylight hours despite being in an upmarket city centre location. The front desk can't even see the front doors, so you have to justify yourself over the intercom. The hotel door cards don't work on the front door card machine (despite being labelled for customers), to which the receptionist just replied ""door keys only work in your door"". What's the point in the door key scanner at the front entrance then?? What kind of hotel is this?  When we stayed in Sept 2020 there was no hot breakfast available. For a central London 4* hotel that's just unacceptable. There was no visible warning about this when i booked via the hilton website. There was also no welcome cookie on check-in, nor any kind of replacement.   We booked the king suite, which is supposedly the best room in the hotel. The decor was tired, the stairway up to the room was covered in plastic due to ongoing renovations and there were no tea or coffee facilities in the room. We originally booked for £280 but cancelled under the covid policy and rebooked for £180. Even that is too much for this joke of a hotel.  Honestly, the worst part of this hotel are the staff. They're useless and they just don't care. Upon check-in as a gold honours member i was repeatedly told ""select breakfast in your app. I'm standing right in front of you. Why do i need to use my phone to re-communicate my request to you? In any case, breakfast was already selected in the app, to which the receptionist was, as usual, confused.   When we gave the staff their feedback on departure they firstly argued then just shrugged. That tells you what you need to know. Hilton should ditch this property ASAP.…",Date of stay: September 2020,1.0

She took my temperature due to covid restrictions. She checked me in efficiently, however the reason I have given this hotel a 4* is because upon arrival I was allocated a room that was unfortunately very dirty and hadn’t been cleaned. The bathroom is shocking but when I called Alexandra to let her know, she sincerely apologised and allocated a new room for us.  The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable.

I’ve reviewed several others in London with very favorable results.  However, my recent stay at the Marble Arch hotel left me a bit underwhelmed and frustrated.  I would highly recommend other Doubletrees in London but will not likely stay here again.  Pros: - The rooms are nice and well finished - The bathroom is very good size with a nice shower  Cons: - The rooms are tiny and have way to much furniture in them.  Also, the desk chairs are way too big for the space.   This room size is not atypical in London.  However, if you have small rooms you need to make sure the furniture is not made for a normal sized room. - The rooms are very noisy.

The room was quiet big with a king bed, wide screen tv with lots of channels and a great bathroom. The room was very clean and everyday chocolate waited for us on the bed. We haven't ate at the hotel since it was quiet expensive. The hotel location is so good that you can find lots of coffee shops and local restaurants nearby. As I said the location is unbeatable- just steps from OXxford street and 3 minutes walk to the Marble Arch tube station. The only minus of this hotel is the wifi. They give you a code to use in the public areas (sometimes it works even in the room) but there was a lot of problems logging in.

This place exceeded expectations and we are actually staying there again next week.  First time I've stayed at the same hotel in London twice.  I think we paid around £150 for our room, which is the going rate.  The only downside is that there's no really perfect way to get to Heathrow.  Taxi is the most direct.  Tube requires a train-change which is a pain with big bags.  Still - this place was clean, modern, kind of techy, and we were very pleased with it.
