I went downstairs to speak with the guy in the desk who was reluctant to come and sort something saying I could just prop the tv up. Then blamed it on the cleaner probably breaking it. Bed sheets WERE clean and the bed was comfy which is the only thing I can say. The shower curtain rail was broken as was the bin in the bathroom. The base of the bed was stained and upon further investigation there was rubbish underneath. The radiator and walls were dirty as were the drawers. There was a rat trap by the desk and plug-in deterrents in the drawers ( a little nerving). The radiator was broken, there was a shade missing from the 2 lights above the bed and there was a strange drip marks in the ceiling light. The carpet was frayed and dirty. Â£75 for one night including parking seemed great. Saw one review saying in October they had no coffee and when I asked on my visit in November, they still didnâ€™t have any. There were more photos but I can only upload 10. The hotel says it has lots of complimentary toiletries. Well there was one tiny soap. On the door there was a sign stating the hotel cannot be liable for any loss or damage to anything in the rooms including cash and insist that when you go out you have the key to reception! Makes you think they go into the rooms for a snoop and opportunity to steal cash etc. Even at a cheap price they could take more care in the rooms and we have since seen better hotels for similar prices. Will NOT recommend nor use this hotel again. â€¦",Date of stay: November 2019,1.0

The hotel is great located and couple min walk to nearest underground station. Plus plenty bus stops about also so no probs transport wise. Nice cheap hotel for weekend but for price got it always gonna be small bits broke or not best looking but it had beds tv that was the main thing. First hotel though that ive ever had to hand keys back in everytime we left hotel, not sure if some others do it but first hotel ive stayed in that ever had to do that thought was little strange.   Ants if dont like ants might not be for you but for myself and son we can live with the odd ants crawling about. Not too mamy at one time bit could maybe become a prob over time. One shower doors was missing replaced by a shower curtain wasnt a prob easy to use and cover area replacing. One thing that was annoying and maybe little in others eyes was a spoon. Son wanted a cup of tea so picked up spoon and see in pics was absolutley manky now easy washed but shouldve been checked and cleaned before checked in.

We payed about 50 pounds for a double room inc. breakfast, which is very cheap in london. The double room we got was quite small with old furniture, but the bed was nice and confy and the room and bathroom were both very clean. Our room had a 14"" TV/DVD combo (no remote control, but it wasn't necessary with such a small room!). Breakfast was early (between  7 and 9), and consisted in english breakfast and toast. The location was great, just a 5 min walk away from marble arch, and there were several grocery stores and restaurants in edgware road open till late. ",Date of stay: November 2006,4.0

It's a two star hotel, and is fairly quiet.  Myself and a few friends stayed there for one night recently.  One couple stayed in a double room ensuite for Â£60 a night. It was OK, nothing special, but clean and functional.  Some of the single rooms are very dated and would benefit from complete refurbishment. Some are quite small. Some are not ensuite (There are shower cubicles and WCs in the corridor).  Some of the rooms do not have a phone, and have a small portable CRT 14 inch TV from the 1980's.   In this world, you get what you pay for, and if you pay Â£40 for a single room in such a central location, then don't expect it to be like the Hilton.  If you have fairly high standards, then you will not be happy to stay inâ€¦",Date of stay: November 2006,3.0
