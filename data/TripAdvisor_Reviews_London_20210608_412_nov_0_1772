Room was modern and looked clean. No hygiene seal on the door to say rooms been sanitised though as per their website and Novotel guidelines. Shower was powerful and warm. There’s no baths in any rooms unless your in a suite . We had a few issues which they resolved. The sofa beds are uncomfortable for the children, my daughter couldn’t sleep very well as she said it was really uncomfortable.   Breakfast took ages now it’s table service and portions are small. However I think you can ask for more as it’s replaced the all you can eat buffet . I don’t think it’s worth the price though.  Good location near the London eye (10 minute  walk) . There’s a few bus stops over the road and more within a 2 minute walk.  There’s not much near the hotel in way of places to eat and shops. There is a Tesco express and a nisa within a 5 minute walk.   Lovely views from the suite- can see top of the London eye and Big Ben.   Not the nicest Novotel I’ve stayed in but also not the worse. It’s very basic compared to other Novotel’s, in respect of the services it offer, most   Novotel’s have pools, room service etc . The services here are more of that offered at  a premier inn.  Due to Covid there is no housekeeping unless you specifically request it .…",Date of stay: June 2021,4.0

We found the staff very friendly and helpful (provided our daughter with plasters as she had blisters from all our walking!) Also the room was very clean and huge television for children to watch!   However, there were a few issues. To start, the room wasn't made up for family of 4 when we arrived, reception told us this would be done later while we were out for dinner.    After a lot of walking we were looking forward to a nice cup of tea in the room. Unfortunately  there were only 2 cups, two small milk pots and no spoons. And while the sink in the bathroom looks nice and trendy it is too shallow to fit kettle under the tap. As promised the room was made up for 4 while we were out but they forgot to provide extra towels, pillows and tea/coffee facilities. We bought our own milk while out, to put in fridge but discovered that didn't work. I addition, the USB chargers by bed didn't work either.   The mattresses were hard but we were so tired we were just grateful to go to bed.   Shower not very powerful, water didn't drain quickly so had to keep turning off shower to drain water so it didn't overflow.  Breakfast was ok, luckily it was included in the price we paid, it seemed very expensive for what is was as an extra!   Overall I think we will stay in Premier Inn in future as at least you get comfortable beds.…",Date of stay: June 2021,3.0

I stayed here for a week with work. Rooms are lovely  and spacious beds are comfy although the pillows could be better (they’re a bit soft and lumpy) The bathrooms are great, fabulous shower! Great pressure and lots of hot water. Good air conditioning in the rooms and the windows open too.   I went just after the Covid lockdowns had eased so not sure if this is why or not but the hotel was lovely and quiet! The wales seem quite sturdy too so nose doesn’t creep through. Just what I needed for a week of work.   The breakfasts were restricted due to lockdown but you can order a variety of items off a breakfast menu and they were really flexible and accommodating, I.e you could order a full English or (like me) just order a few items off the full English, there was also cereal, continental, avocado toast so a really decent selection for what is classed as a “restricted menu”. It would be good to have an option of cold water at breakfast for those of us who can’t drink coffee or don’t like juice.   Again due to Covid the rooms are not being cleaned or serviced everyday which wasn’t a problem but it would have been good just to have the bins checked or emptied each day.   The staff were really friendly and helpful (especially when I needed plasters for some blisters) and by the end of the week they had memorised my breakfast order (yes I’m predictable) and it was nice to be able to have a friendly chat with them.   Would definitely stay here again and would recommend for anyone who wants a nice clean, comfy and quiet hotel to explore London from! …",Date of stay: May 2021,4.0

Close proximity to the London Eye New year fireworks celebration was the reason for choosing this place.   I was not disappointed as the Lambeth bridge was just a minute walk from the hotel and was a great place to view the new year celebration. The Hop On hop off and the London bus stops were also close by. So sight seeing and local commute was a breeze.   The check in and check out process was simple and quick. Express checkout was just a second - to handover the room key. That’s awesome and consistent with rest of Europe and US.  The property itself was a simple one. The room was relatively small.

Despite the ""London Waterloo"" tag, the hotel is actually in Lambeth Road opposite Lambeth Palace, about a mile from Waterloo station.  The nearest tube station is Lambeth North, about a 12 minute walk away.  Two bus routes pass the door, the 3 (Whitehall - Crystal Palace) and 344 (Clapham Junction - Elephant & Castle).  Sadly the 3 has been recently cut back from Oxford Circus to Whitehall, thereby severing the direct link with London's theatreland.  However, Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament are about a 12 minute walk away, so the location is good for tourists.

This time we stayed for just one night. We weren't sure if we were upgraded on arrival but had a huge room on the fifth floor. However, there was no view - it seemed to be above a car park entrance.   This is a 4* hotel and you do get that feel in the public areas. However, there was definitely room for improvement in the room:   1. The towels were old. Now I'm all for reusing towels and am not necessily a fan of big fluffy ones but these were definitely past their best being very thin - they needed to be recycled and replaced;   2.

Sadly this time was not so good as, although a great variety as always, the food was not very warm. Also, as with all other Hotels in London, their prices were increased considerably knowing it was going to be a busy weekend due to the Peoples March for Armistice Day. Really annoying but will definitely stay again though.",Date of stay: November 2018,4.0

I asked two members of staff before it finally arrived a long while after we had finished our main meal. Main meals were limited but no complaints with breakfast. There was choice for everyone.  The room was lovely and modern although the heating didn’t seem to work. One thing to note is the traffic outside is constant all night which didn’t bother us but may bother some?

And Lambeth is a pretty quiet location for a London suburb with regards to tourists and traffic.

Only down falls are the beds/pillows are not as comfy as most Novotels and that breakfast and the restaurant down stairs is VERY pricey for what it is - 16Euro for a poor buffet breakfast and 38Euro for 2 burgers for dinner.

Calling the hotel, Novotel stated it would show-up on the hotel bill. Mistake-1. Arrived Friday-nite and parking out front had several cars. I had to park behind the cars slightly in the street.

The bar was pretty reasonable food was okay. Everyone is right about the location everything is quite a walk which is okay during the day but not at night. Location for myself was good, nice view of parliment etc and a very nice cafe on the river about a 2 min walk. I refused to pay £9 for breakfast. What annoyed me the most about this hotel was the parking. £24 a DAY!!!!! I probably would'nt stay here again one because of the location in the evening I dont want to walk miles to find a nice restaurant and especially because of the parking. ",None,2.0

It was OK, but completely lacking in any kind of style or character. The room I stayed in was clean and well equipped but everything - walls, ceiling, light fittings - was unremittingly white; it put me in mind of a hospital. A touch of softening colour would have been welcome (I think even hospitals use colour these days). The substantial buffet breakfast was good and the standard of service was acceptable, so I wouldn't discourage you from staying there although I certainly wouldn't (and didn't) pay the full advertised rate. The area immediately round the hotel is somewhat lacking in local amenities but if you walk along the river embankment towards the former London City Hall you will find a decent selection of restaurants.

Thought the location was fine, only 10 mins walk to Lambeth North Underground or across the bridge to Westminster.  The area was a bit quiet, but you are only a few stops on the underground to the nightlife of Soho, Chinatown, etc.  We had a good sized double room with a great bathroom.  The room was clean and well-equipped.  The staff we encountered were all polite and spoke fluent English although it was not their first language.  The breakfast buffet was excellent with a huge choice of items to start the day with.  If I'd been paying for it I would probably not have had it as it was expensive.

This was a last minute trip to London, and we waited until arriving in London to find a hotel. We chose this hotel upon recommendation by a person in the train station.

During the day, the walk is fine. At night, I would not make the walk alone. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel, but buses are not always the most reliable or predictable.

The area is quiet, and it is about 10 minutes walk to somewhere to eat and around 15 - 20 minutes to the London Eye.  I would take a cab in the evening if I was a woman alone - the area is a bit off the beaten track and I would have felt vulnerable without colleagues in tow.  Stayed for 5 days on business and all the meals were delicious, but marred by the first evening when I got food poisoning from some dodgy mussels (but that could happen anywhere I suppose).  Beware that the hotel seems to be in a 'black hole' when it comes to mobile reception - I could only make calls by almost hanging out the window, and use of email by laptop therefore very difficult.

We were all very disappointed.  I'll tell you why.  First of all, I should say that the price was great - kids stayed free so the family room with a double bed, a single bed and a rollaway bed was very reasonable at 125 pounds.
