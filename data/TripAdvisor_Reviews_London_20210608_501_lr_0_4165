Sanitised and safety measures in place, the hotel was spotlessly clean. Very reassuring.  Our room was spacious and once again, spotlessly clean. Yes, the hotel and the room seemed tired and due for a refurb, but plans have been approved by the local authority to redevelop the entire area and pull down the hotel. So it just wouldn't be worth it. But to concentrate on that would be missing the point. The location is fantastic, and the price even better. So no complaints at all. Plus you have to spare a thought for the hardworking staff in the hospitality industry hit hard by the pandemic. And they welcome you with a smile and are very attentive. We will be returning asap.......for as long as the hotel is still standing!!…",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

We pre-booked the parking under the hotel which was actually the better option as it was slightly cheaper however the parking was easy to find and felt very secure. The hotel itself is in a great location and is realistically your typical London hotel which great decor and fancy receptions. We were greeted by a lovely member of staff to which I, unfortunately, did not get the name of however he made our stay that much better.

Went back, changed cards. The room was on floor 2 which the whole corridor smelt like weed. So changed rooms to floor 6. The door was broken, wood hanging off. Black hair in the bath. Toilet wasn’t very clean. Dinner was ordered via phone to pick up, went to collect & the order was wrong. They brought up my correct order, which gave me an upset stomach. The food wasn’t hot, which was probably why. They said breakfast would be open at 6.30, went down to collect the ‘breakfast bag’ but got told to go back at 7. Collected the bag & it feels like a school pack lunch. Carton of orange juice, apple, yoghurt, belvita bar, croissant  & a muffin. I said that they said an egg bap would be available, but I was told you either get the bap or the bag.

On our most recent visit in August standards were not as good in the cleanliness department.  However, following a visit last year when I was kindly given a mattress topper to assist with back pain, I was grateful to receive one of these once more, so the staff are helpful and this was appreciated.  I would say that things like skirting boards, areas in the shower that are difficult to get to, are the areas that are being missed on the cleaning.  This may be because the staff are not given enough time, I don't know.  The car park is great but for the past couple of years, that has also been pretty dirty.  Location is great though.

Comfortable room.,"I arrived in the morning from Heathrow.  They did not have the type of room I had booked available then, but offered me a twin instead. I was just wanting to sleep, so that was fine. They offered me a slight discount on breakfast the next day.  This hotel is huge, and my room was on the 15th floor - so it was very quiet.  It is very close to the Gloucester Road tube station, several grocery stores, and other useful places.  My room was very comfortable. The breakfast wasn't the best, but typical of a large hotel.  I would stay here a gain if the price was right.",Date of stay: April 2018,4.0

Let's get real. The prices for this hotel are very good for the level of comfort, and the facilities here, and the proximity to the Tube, is great. However, there are some downsides to this place, too. Please see the pros and cons below.

The Italian staff in particular (they wear little flags on their lapels to show the staff's nationality) seemed to be very focused on customer service. One staff member named Jacopo stood out in particular in this respect, and was a credit to this hotel. - The rooms are normal…",Date of stay: May 2013,3.0

Breakfast was good and if you are hungry in the morning you have value for money for £ 12.95 (ask for a voucher at the front desk if breakfast is not included in your rate) but be  early for breakfast because there are always groups in the hotel.

It's a big hotel, and feels recently renovated. Through Expedia, I got a room for $120 Canadian/night. It turned out to be very spacious, clean, and everything felt quite new and well maintained. Even the bathroom was huge, with a soaker tub and shower. Two twin beds in the room had nice duvets rather than scratchy hotel blankets on them. The location was fabulous. It's right around the corner from Gloucester Road tube station which is on the Piccadilly line and very convenient if you like to go to theatre in the West End. There are quite a few shops near Gloucester Road station, including a big Waitrose supermarket. The neighbourhood felt safe too. Holiday Inn K-F also has an all-day baggage check room,…",Date of stay: August 2003,5.0

We loved the clean rooms (although small, but hey! it's Europe). The Continental breakfast was included in our rate and it was quite satisfying; the service was great, everyone was friendly. The hotel is in the great Kensington area of London, quiet, safe and conveniently located a block from the Gloucester Underground station.

My cousin and I arrived late on a Saturday night and were very dissapointed by the hotel that we had booked our room with. We walked six blocks to the Holiday Inn and explained our situation. They graciously put us into an executive suite room for the night and then offered us a special rate for the week that included breakfast. The room was clean, modern and we mostly importantly felt safe. I would stay there again and would recommend it to anyone.",None,5.0

No hot water in my shower for well over 24 hours after 2 calls to maintenance.  A missed wake up call because the person at the front desk didn't speak English enough to understand me.  Smaller than normal room.  All these things are what is leading me to write this review.  After reading the ones already on the web site I thought we had found an oasis in the storm that is London.  We decided to go with the Holiday Inn because of their good reputation world wide and we ended up being rather disappointed.  Stay away from the buffet and go to the local bakery down the street..save yourself the money.  The service was horrible and the food was average at best.  No where near worth the…,None,2.0

The hotel is going through renovation and we were lucky enough to get a new room.  The room itself was wonderful and big for London standards.  It had a modern comfortable look.  We got into London at 8am and they let us check-in at 9am.  It has over 900 rooms so for us early check-in was no problem.  I paid about $100 U.S. for the room.  I booked it 2 weeks before we left on the Holiday Inn web site which I found was the cheapest.  The hotel is 2 blocks(3 minute walk) from the Gloucester Tube Station.

We were supposed to stay at another hotel, but for some reason (no rooms available or whatever) the travel agency ended up taking us to the Holiday Inn.I must say we had a very pleasant stay. The rooms were very nice, comfortable, quiet, and extremely clean. The buffet breakfast was incredible, with an included continental one (the english one was a little bit expensive, but worth it). I would definitely stay again at this hotel, and I find it highly recomendable for anyone. I think the little expensiveness of the english breakfast had something to do with the pound thing (the pound itself is extremely, I would say stupidly, expensive, and that's all the secret of it).
