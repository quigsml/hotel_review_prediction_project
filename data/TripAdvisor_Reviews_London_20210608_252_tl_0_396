I did, my own fault entirely), with a team of people so committed to making your stay enjoyable, and I'd guess you will be searching for a very long time - and that's before we even consider the excellent price.   It's right beside Raynes Park station, 20 mins to central London, plus you have a lot of places to eat (try Matheou's Fish Bar and Restaurant - excellent!) right on your door step, including a couple of nice pubs.  But what really makes this hotel is the staff who work here - each and every one of them take ownership of running this place like a well oiled machine, it really matters to them and it shows.  I've been staying here weekly since August 2020 and I've always had such a lovely welcome at reception, along with every encounter I've had with any of the nice people who make this place tick - I haven't picked up every name, but I'd like to mention Ana, Josh, Javi and the lady who (I think) manages the housekeeping team (sorry, I don't know her name). Honestly, so helpful and can't do enough for you and in my opinion, that's what makes a stay so enjoyable.   This is my last stay here for a while and I'll miss it, especially the cracking team that work here. Thanks guys.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: June 2021,5.0

Staff here are exceptionally hard-working and have a tough job meeting and exceeding the expectations of countless weary travellers from all walks of life.   My own journey has afforded me the absolute pleasure of their kind hospitality during countless stays throughout the horrendous pandemic.   I have witnessed touching moments between team-members and have experienced first-hand the genuine camaraderie that exists.   There is nothing in this world stronger than the bonds that hold together and support a family.   This team is like a family and this short note I pray, will reach the desk of exactly the right person able to recognise and appropriately reward them.  Furthermore and quite astonishingly, I estimate to have been booked in by the same concierge 80% of the time. Clearly she has supernatural powers as she always seems to appear at precisely the right time.  Team-member Ana has been my guardian angel and words cannot begin to express my appreciation for her conduct and her care.  Thank you!  John üíô‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2021,5.0

We're not fussy and don't expect new towels and bedding every day but we did think that someone may have popped in to check if we needed anything. The room was clean when we arrived (and reasonably clean when we left.....) hence the rating. However the questions in the survey were not relevant to cleaning during the stay. Go figure.

Factor in noisy deliveries being made to the Coop next door, and you have the recipe for a very noisy room.

Booked a 'light breakfast' on the first morning which was good.  We decided to repeat this on the second morning but the breakfast was very poor - the dregs of granola, no natural yogurt, fruit juice that was like coloured water, no fresh fruit at all, so we basically had tea and toast and a bit of granola.  Tables were also not cleared quickly too. After a complaint from us, the management did refund us as they did not want us to be dissatisfied with our stay in any way.
