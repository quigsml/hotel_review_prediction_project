Best Western Hotel offered the best value for money. We were quite happy with our triple room and the facilities provided. The room was nice and clean, everything worked properly. There was a big window, that looked out on the street, but once you closed it, there was very little traffic noise.  Our room was in a different building, from the main reception/dining facilities building, but it didn't bother us much. For me, the fact that going up to our room involved climbing several flights of stairs was slightly more inconvenient. Anyways, our luggage was light, and the lovely young man who showed us to our room, offered to carry it for us. Since, there is no lift, the hotel might be inconvenient for people with mobility issues. However, it is 5 mins walk away from Victoria Station, so one can explore London quite easily, given the transport links. Also, it is easy to go to Victoria Station from Euston train station, in case you are travelling to London from up north, like us.…",Date of stay: February 2020,5.0

After visiting that location and experiencing no problems, reasonable pricing and a spacious double room, I was severely disappointed in the London branch. PROS -  1) Check in and check out was fast and efficient with no problems 2) Front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly 3) Internet/ Wifi services were great with good connection throughout and seldom dropped calls. They even facilitated easy streaming.  CONS - 1) Rooms were much smaller than I expected especially for a double room. The toilet and shower were extremely cramped as well. You could hear your neighbours very easily and whenever anyone opened/ closed doors or walked up/down stairs. 2) Water heating when showering was fickle. Sometimes the water would get freezing cold while showering and then extremely hot. As I stayed 7 days this began to get extremely irritating. 3) Breakfast was not included in the package and for 12.50 pounds for breakfast, this was extremely steep compared with delicious cheaper options nearby. Even friends living years in England were astounded by the price. 4) I asked room service on 2 occasions for an extra roll of toilet paper but left my stay without getting this. I understand the Corona Virus pandemic and shortages but I was merely asking for 1 roll. Luckily I didn't stay one day extra.  5) Pricing overall was a bit high for what I experienced. I understand it is the city but if I had the same experience as I did in Fort Lauderdale, I would not have complained about this last point.  OVERALL - I wouldn't recommend for people staying above 2 days. Definitely could pay a cheaper price in an Airbnb or pay a little bit more at another place for breakfast included.   …",Date of stay: March 2020,2.0

For the 150 pounds a night (breakfast not included) I paid at the BW Victoria Palace I got a small room with two single beds on the 5th floor (no lift).

Never having stayed in a London hotel before I was a bit shocked at my room - which was about 6x6 and then the bathroom, maybe 6x4.  No dresser, a desk smaller than a student desk, no luggage rack.  Nice bed, great featherbed, fine staff, wonderful English breakfast, but I'm glad I didn't have claustrophobia.  Looking at the floor plan, and seeing inside the room across the hall being made up, some rooms were bigger than mine and others smaller.  This unit did have an elevator.  Again, the staff and the breakfast made up for the size of my room -sort of.  But 600 pounds did seem a bit excessive for four nights. ",Date of stay: August 2019,3.0

This hotel is a 10 minute walk from Victoria station to connect with the railroad and underground.  It's about a 20 minute walk to many of the most famous sights in London.  There are several nice pubs within a couple blocks.  The locations was marvelous.  The rooms were small, so it was a challenge stowing the luggage, but otherwise it was a very comfortable, basic room.  The front desk was very helpful and friendly.  They helped us arrange a very early shuttle ride to the airport and even unlocked the breakfast area so we could get a bowl of cereal before we departed.
