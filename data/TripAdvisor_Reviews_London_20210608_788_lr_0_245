Friendly service and helpful staff but then we saw the room. Their website claims 'fully refurbished', once perhaps but not recently, certainly not Room 18. Stained carpet and dirty walls, no working safe or bathroom door lock. The shower was reasonable but the mixer was a bath one and therefore protruded in to the precious shower space. No plug in a sink do small we couldn't fill the room's kettle, this had to be done by using a cup to fill it. The room was small and being over 6ft doesn't allow you to lie out stretched.

My personal advice is either stick with the hotels in the airport area or make higher bids.  Pros: - location. Bus 9,10 can take u pretty much anywhere in the city. And you can get to the tube from here pretty easily. - they will make ur bed and replace the used towels and shampoos  - view from window is ok if u look far away...  Cons: - the spring mattress is heavily worn and caves inwards in middle. Can't sleep well. - no AC, only a noisy fan and window is sealed shut. Luckily it's winter time. - tiny room.

The rooms looked small on the website and most reviews talked about how tiny they were...but until you see them in person you really don't know what you're in for. I think the website must only show a suite or something because my room (a single) had a twin bed smaller than I've ever seen, and it was about the only thing that fit in the room. The bed went along the wall facing the street, and then there were about two feet of space between the bed and wall, IF that. The bathroom was tiny as well - everything was so crammed in there, there was hardly a space to stand.  Because the room was so small and because the window only‚Ä¶",Date of stay: September 2009,2.0

It took us a good ten minutes to walk there with heavy bags only to be told that we were being put in their sister hotel 'The Holland Inn Hotel'. It was a further 10 min walk which miffed me a bit and I was dreading what we would find but I was pleasantly surprised. The room should of been ready at 1pm but in fact when we got there we were told it would be after 2pm but we were assured that we would be given their best room for the inconvenience. We took a stroll around Kensington which is just around the corner whilst we waited for our room to be ready and we were allowed to leave our bags in reception hallway for free.

Yes the rooms are very small but most people on a trip to London only need them to sleep in and they had every thing you needed - tea making hair dryer even a little fridge.  The hotel was spotlessly clean right through and breakfast was good for what you were paying plenty of cornflakes toast and orange juice.  We found the underground quite good from here but if you want a more frequent service it is a 10-15 min walk down Kensington High Street to that underground where there are more frequent trains.

Kensington High St station is a better option. The rooms are really tiny - clean enough but impossible to move around in. This is a hotel for sleeping only; really it was like being in a cupboard! Breakfast is very basic but again, the breakfast room so small that only about 10 people could squeeze in. The worst feature is the noisy street. Holland Road is like a racetrack at night, and even with the window closed, the noise is bad. It is impossible to leave it open. There is a bright sign over the front door which also lights up the rooms on that side. Internet access costs 5 pounds (flat fee) and works well. There are very basic tea and coffee facilities in the room. I stayed for‚Ä¶",Date of stay: May 2009,2.0

The room and bathroom was very clean. The staff very friendly and honest. Olympia Underground is a 2 minute walk, 20 minutes ride to Picadilly Circus.

Mine was a single room on a budget and I stayed three nights. I'd have liked somewhere to put clothes and stuff but there was neither wardrobe nor chest of drawers. There was, however, a good-sized fridge, a safe, an air-conditioning unit and a good quality television receiving many channels. The en-suite facility worked but the shower drain was slow and the water level crept alarmingly towards the room level. Generally, it's a decent place if you don't mind compromising on comforts and, as the title says, it really is spotlessly clean.",Date of stay: February 2009,4.0

We wanted an affordable London base which was accessible to the city to see the sights etc, and that is exactly what we got. The member of staff on reception was friendly and check in was quick and easy. The room was a twin bed. Room was small and basic, but very clean. The beds were comfortable, with extra blankets provided, there was space to hang clothes, and tea and coffee facilities and towels were provided. The room had a brand new plasma screen TV as well which was a nice added extra.  The bathroom was more of a wetroom, but again, perfectly adequate for our needs.

The pictures were nice and the info from the hotel receptionist said it was refurbished in August 08.         Yes, the twin room on the ground floor was small (as all hotel rooms in London) but clean and new. The bathroom was small but very nice. We were lucky to have a shower with a plastic cover door (I heard not all the rooms had this - read the other reviews).         The only disappointment was that there was NO WINDOW in the room, which was pretty surprising and gave no chance to let the fresh air in. There was just a ""light reflection pipe"" from the roof leading to the ceiling, not giving enough light during the day.

Its a box room with Double bed in it. The basement room has a shower in it but just a hole in the floor for the water to go  NO shower curtain so the loo is soaked when you shower. Breakfast room has enough seats for 7 at a sitting. There are 21 rooms in this hotel !!! Breakfast is cornflakes toast orange juice and cheese that was dried out. Tea and coffee. The location was good though and overall it was a clean hotel. No lifts so 40 steps to bedroom or 20 steps to basement room.
