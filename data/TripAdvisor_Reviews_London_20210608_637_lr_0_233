This was on Saturday and I had to find another accommodation immediately! Fortunately they refunded me at least some money but it took until Tuesday and it was less than it should have been. They used this trick: I had paid three weeks in advance but their invoice shown only two weeks while the third weeks was ""free"". That makes a higher price per night, so they deducted four nights at a higher price than I prepaid and accordingly refunded me less than they should have. The hotel is closed now but may still be taking bookings online and charging people's bank cards, so be careful when booking. It is not the only hotel/hostel doing this these days.…",Date of stay: July 2020,1.0

My room was down one flight of stairs, next to the breakfast room, was a little noisy early in the morning, so if you don't want an early start ask for a room upstairs.  My colleague was given a room at the top of the hotel, if you have a bad heart, the stairs are a killer. The only downside that I found was that there is not a reception room to use if you didn't want to sit in your room.  But would definately use this hotel again.",Date of stay: April 2012,4.0

Decent continental breakfast for the money. Note: no lift so if you're on third floor with heavy bags, not ideal...
