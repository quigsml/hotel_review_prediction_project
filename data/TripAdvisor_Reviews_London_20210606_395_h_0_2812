The bed was HUGE, good size fridge in the room, toiletries supplied and very clean. The club lounge was closed but complementary drinks were served in Ken’s bar on an evening for 2 hours to my partners delight the bottled beer option was Peroni or Corona bottles - excellent choices. I had the house white wine which was nice too. The club room also included continental breakfast in the restaurant or the option to upgrade to a full breakfast for only £5 which we did not expect.

This caused so much chaos and stress in the stairwells, which should not happen in an emergency situation!

One evening we had drinks in the bar area and the service was very slow, which is really our only negative comment on our stay. The concierge was helpful, and for London it was a peaceful neighborhood. A nice touch for Americans is that the bath had one outlet with US current, but note that an adapter for the plug is needed to fit into the outlet.

The Gloucester Rd tube station is a 3 minute walk away and connects you with the Piccadilly, Circle, and District lines, making it easy to access from Heathrow airport as well as many of the train stations (word of warning, though, is that you’ll need to carry your bag up some stairs before exiting the tube station).  Just outside the tube station is a Waitrose grocery store which is perfect to grab some snacks, drinks, and/or breakfast.

Great staff. Wonderful surprises.,"We have stayed in many other hotels in London over the years, but love this one the best. The staff are very helpful. Giancarlo at the front desk was great and seemed to really care about our satisfaction. The hallway and room doors are a bit dated, but the rooms themselves are clean and stylishly remodelled. We lucked out in getting a room that overlooks the back garden with French doors so we had a picnic in a room on our first day. The hotel has a gym and sauna. We recommend booking as year as possible as it gets more expensive each week you delay due to supply and demand. The location is great as it is close to shops, restaurants, grocery stores and the tube. Also the V&A museum and Natural History Museum are close by - easy wal.

So only the tiniest space should you wish to put your own drinks or snacks in the fridge (something quite likely to happen on a week long trip).  *the beds are small, hard and have very very ""firm"" pillows. *lots of light from the downstairs restaurant gets in to the room despite the thick curtains *the temperature in the room is very hard to control - despite the in room controls the room would swing from super hot to freezing cold throughout the night *the anti slip on the bath was like sandpaper…",Date of stay: February 2017,2.0

Unlike the others however, the Crowne does not offer onsite parking, nor a convenient drop off point for guests and their luggage.  One has to park on Cromwell Rd. to facilitate a quick drop off which was less desirable and a tad frustrating.

Check in was easy and professional. The room was nothing more than ok. A little dated but clean. Bed was good and we slept well. Here's the bad bit. Breakfast was a shocker. Loads of tables that hadn't been cleared was the first issue so we had nowhere to sit until that had been dealt with. This is solely down to the complete lack of staff. The food itself was awful. Fried eggs swimming in grease, mushrooms that simply weren't cooked, sausages that looked cheap and bacon that was only just cooked but was cold. The other trays containing what would have been scrambled eggs and beans were empty. The food we chose tasted of nothing, it was without doubt the worst hotel breakfast I've ever had.

This was a leisure trip with my family, although I'm an IHG Platinum from frequent business travel.  The hotel location was good...5-10 min cab from Paddington station.  We had a two level suite which was very roomy.  Although the décor was a bit dated, the extra space was certainly very nice!  The hotel business lounge only served drinks from 6-8pm..which made the amenity useless for us, as the drinks/apps would be put away by the time we returned from our days' activities.  That aside, the hotel bar was very nice..the bar staff was excellent. Sherkhan (sorry about the spelling) and Happy were really great and took good care of us.  Overall a good stay; we would come back..but the lounge does need to improve its' hours to take better care…",Date of stay: November 2014,4.0

I always stay here when in London if possible as the hotel is great, it is very central (Circle LIne) and across the road from Gloucester Tube station.   My upgraded room was awesome - the best room in London by far. The gym is also one of the better gyms in London and so once again an excellent stay and the staff always seem to be very friendly and helpful unlike the Holiday Inn across the road.  However I do have a gripe this stay: - the breakfast was a little disapointing, it seemed a little unappetising and as if it was just thrown together , the bacon was terrible (this is my personal taste of course) but I would rather go outside the hotel and have a lovely fresh breakfast for half the price.  I was unable to get a late checkut but I do understand this…",Date of stay: May 2013,5.0
