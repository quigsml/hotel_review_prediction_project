","Travelling for work during the pandemic.  When arriving I had to say that I’m a HH Gold member, as they didn’t check the booking notes ahead of time.  But once I said it, the lady at the reception desk thanked my for being a Gold member. (Some recognition as a frequent traveller but not as would be expected - no special benefits or recognition apart from the water in the room and the breakfast - no upgrade to my knowledge and I’m pretty sure the hotel was not full - no requests for preferences like bath tub/shower from reception). In this pandemic you would think hotels would go out of their ways to keep their loyal customers. But it didn’t feel like they were happy to see me.   I asked if there were diner options (in the room) but there were none. So had to choose for some kind of delivery service, which could be left at the reception (table installed).   Checking in was short but polite.  Continental Breakfast was brought up to the room she informed me. I just had to choose the hour and what kind of hot drink) Breakfast was disappointing for Hilton, but talk later about that). Overall impression that the hotel was clean on what the eye could see.   When I arrived in the room, the television was on but only white noise on it.  It startled me.  I had a specious room on the backside of the hotel (102) first floor. It looked over some kind of a high-tea room. The hotel is somewhat older but has nice high ceilings. My room was also very quiet, what I always appreciate.  Carpet on the floor. I’m not a fan.   I slept very well and the beds are comfy.   Shower was easy to control and nice hot water with firm beam, if desired. (Softer was also possible of course)  Good bright lights in the bathroom. With also the option to use a blue light. (Nightly visits that don’t hurt the eyes - toilet in the bathroom.)  Now breakfast, I did not know what to expect, but since it’s Hilton you expect something decent. I was happy that it was brought up to the room.  Well, I was quite disappointed though.  I only got one single dry older croissant. No butter, only jam. A yoghurt (Activia) which I ate out of pure hunger (but later regretted as my body doesn’t get happy from Yoghurt - lactose) and a coffee (Cappuccino) - paper cup seems to be half full. And an orange juice (no choice of juice).  That was it... I was left hungry and disappointed...   The hotel has a convenient location.  Very close to Euston.  And not far from St-Pancras (Eurostar) / Kings Cross.   Check out was smooth.   …",Date of stay: March 2021,3.0

The Hilton Euston is very small. The rooms are irregular shaped, some are worse than other but none are of any major size. The furnishings are laminate composites and not trendy or stylishly ugly and cheap looking. The floors are an uneven nightmare of soft spots,some bad enough I wrenched an ankle in my room. The bedding actually fairly good but the mattresses are bad. On the 4th floor rooms the windows are in the walls that angle, this means you can't actually black out light since the curtains hang away from the angled wall.

Added to that, the wifi was intermittent and slow at best. The receptionist was very polite and receptive to my comments on the subject. ",Date of stay: January 2014,3.0

I pulled the bed further away from the wall to give a bigger gap, obviously this lessened the limited space the other side. The bed was uncomfortable which led to 2 days of restless sleep. the condition of the room was ok but the mini wardrobe had the trim hanging off the edge which I caught my jumper on , snagging it in the process.

To be honest, as I was only 15 my memory can't really help.

Brutal marble sinks. 3 tonne cathode ray TV's. The ubiquitous Corby trouser press.

But preserve they have - and to be honest they've preserved rather well.   The room is something of a timewarp - Not old and tatty. More old and polished.

I've stayed in quite a few hiltons in London including the Park Lane, Islington, Kensington, Canary Wharf, and the Metropole. I've also stayed at quite a few other hotels so feel qualified to say that this is by far the worst Hilton I've stayed in, and one of the worst hotels I've stayed in in London.  To be positive about the hotel:  - location is very convenient for Euston station - Nice building from the outside - Clean common areas on the ground floor and basement restaurant  Only one person manning reception on arrival and no HHonors line was present.

I had asked for a quiet room but on checking in, found out that this would be impossible because of my impossible request - a double room. The noise was incredible - we couldn't hear the television over the traffic noise - just next to a major crossroads, Euston Train Station, and two bus stops. We had the Continental Breakfast - only one day as our first day the orange juice was old and watered down - not to mention a funny color. The room, being in a London hotel, was of course impossibly small - climbing-over-the-bed-to-get-to- the-chair small. The chain for the bathtub plug was wrapped around the faucet and impossible to get out, the water pressure was so low as to be almost…",Date of stay: January 2005,2.0

I booked the hotel through Orbitz and got a fantastic rate for a 4* (or so I thought)... but, you get what you pay for, i suppose. Overall, I was disappointed with the hotel. I had notified the hotel that I would be arriving early on my check-in date (9am), and they said they would have my room ready. Unfortunately, upon arrival, they were totally confused and had no room ready (despite admitting that they had noted my early arrival in their computer). After waiting for 30 mins while my room was cleaned, I was taken upstairs to a a very TINY ""executive suite"" -- even by London standards, this room was miniscule... and, as an executive who stays in suites often, I can tell you that this was certainly NOT an acceptable…",None,2.0

The staff there at the hotel and also at the fitness centre attached are some of the most fantastic left in this industry. They go above and beyond to take care of their customers. I was very ill one time at the hotel and the staff went out of their way to supply with me with Hot Tea and other things in my room without me asking. The staff at the reception desk are very caring and considerate. This hotel is kept extremely clean and the renovation has made the rooms excellent. I have now stayed at this hotel over 3 times in 2003 not one single time did they fail to provide a wonderful atmosphere and a wonderful room. I would recommend this hotel to all Business people for their care their facilities and their…,None,5.0

The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, the room large and comfortable and the food was excellent.  I have stayed a number of times since then only to find a smaller room each time and staff that became less and less helpful.  My recent visit was the worst and the last: I was put into the tiniest room ever - smaller than my box room - with windows so drafty that my curtains moved. It was so cold that I had to ask for an additional heater. To top it all off, the road outside was so busy that I was woken up in the early hours of the morning. I went down to an expensive breakfast (not included) to find tinned fruit as the main attraction. I tried the gym where the water was actually heated and was told the wrong times…",None,2.0

They don't care!,I thought this hotel would be value for money when they offered me a quiet room in the centre of Bloomsbury in January 2002. I was wrong.  They switched my booking and gave me a room on the front at the junction of two busy roads. there is no double glazing and the traffic noise all night was horrendous.  Don't bother to complain. I filled in their customer service form and wrote to the manager twice after my visit. It si march and I am still waiating for any reply.  Don't stay. They don't care. ,None,1.0
