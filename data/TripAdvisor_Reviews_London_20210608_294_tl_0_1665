Was somewhat therapeutic to stop and watch in the midst of my busy schedule. Bed and pillows were comfy. Clean. Bath was small but wasn't a problem for me as I'm 5""2. There's a pizza take away, Chinese, chicken and chips and a londis about a 4 minute walk away. Only downside wasn't the hotels fault. Had a group of young people going in and out of eachothers rooms until 2:30am then they  we're back at it again from 8:30am when they finally checked out. Once in their rooms I couldn't hear anything thank goodness. Just the hotel doors shut with a slam so I didn't get the peace I was looking for but thats not down to the hotel.

Travelodge now represents good value, functional and well designed rooms which are clean and comfortable with well trained and attentive staff.  We opted for the Super Room which gives a few extras and I think is worth the extra.  This hotel is well located - my recommendation if coming by foot is to get off the train at either Canning Town or Pontoon Dock and get the 474 bus which literally stops outside.  We arrived by train getting off at London City (the closest station) but this is a 10 minute walk.  The hotel suggested the bus which runs every 10 minutes and was perfect for getting into London and the O2. ",Date of stay: November 2019,5.0

Unfortunately I didn’t feel very welcome throughout the stay. Check in was a bit lukewarm. Receptionist was more keen on stressing I should hurry if I’m going to order any food as the kitchen closes at 10pm (it was just past 9pm). Didn’t get the iron until asking for a second time. Room was clean however the mug and disposable cup must’ve been a few days old. Only positive experience was the breakfast, staff were helpful and smiling. Checking out, lady didn’t even ask how my stay was, which is a shame because I wanted to tell someone about the little things that didn’t go so well. Let’s just say I won’t be rushing back to this particular hotel.",Date of stay: November 2017,3.0

The room was clean and comfortable and the staff very friendly. There is aircraft noise but the planes do not fly during the night so it is not a problem. The public areas at the front are a little off putting, it appeared that a lot of workmen used it as a stop over perhaps while working locally, but I would recommend it for a stay before an early flight.",Date of stay: November 2013,4.0

We stayed here as we had an early flight to Luxembourg and were not disappointed. Our room was basic, but clean and of good size. The bed was very comfortable and the soundproofing excellent.  We dined out at nearby Canary Wharf, but called in for a night cap in the hotel bar afterwards. It was well stocked, the service here (as with the check in upon arrival), friendly and efficient.  Delivers what it 'says on the tin'. We will use it again.",Date of stay: November 2013,4.0

The hotel was fine. Usual Travelodge with basic facilities, but clean and with a very comfortable bed. Tea and coffee making facilities always a bonus. Good location for the airport and easy to get into central London via DLR. The breakfast was fine. Nothing fancy but plenty enough to start the day. Very good value for a London hotel.

We were meeting our son from Uni to see Mickey Flannigan on the Saturday but decided to book in from the Friday.  The receptionist on arrival was very good, asked why we were staying and then suggested alternative routes which made sense.  I have read reviews about the lack of soap in the hotel but who really travel away for the weekend or a holiday and don't take shower gel.( They did provide kettle, coffee,tea and sugar). There is a esso garage providing a lot around the corner  The breakfast I thought was good value, English cooked breafast, cereals, toasts, jams, croissants, muffins, yoghurts, teas, coffee, juice, water.

Room was basic but in the same breath I would like to stress that it was very clean and was exactly what I expected for the money I paid and in line with reviews I had read. If I was being extremely picky I would recommend the hotel supplied shower gel, however I didn't come to expect this.  The hotel seemed as if it had just had a facelift so to speak. I had a meal in the bar area which was to a good standard and was served promptly.  I would highly recommend this hotel for anybody looking for an overnight stay for a flight.

The room was clean and tidy, the staff very friendly and helpful.  It was no problem to get extra tea and coffee for our room and the food at the bar was good too.  The only downside i would say was that one of our large towels went vanished after being used leaving us with only one bathtowel and one small towel but they dealed with this straight away and our compliementary bar of soap also vanished but only minor issues.

Only bad thing was the TV which was awful (4:3 aspect, bad sound and picture). Location is about 10 mins walk from either City Airport DLR or Pontoon Dock DLR but either way it is not a particularly pleasant walk, and after dark it can feel rather abandoned and lonely around these parts. However Canary Wharf is only 15 minutes away via Jubilee at Canning Town so location is convenient. Rooms were well insulated so no discernible aircraft noise in the early mornings. Thames Barrier gardens are close by for a bit of green space (the cafe is good there too) but apart from this there's nothing to keep you in the local area. Overall a typical Travelodge which provides clean, cheap and convenient accommodation.",Date of stay: October 2013,3.0

Stayed here on Sat 5th Oct to find the hotel has been totally revamped.  Reception and restaurant looks great with new carpets and paint job and the room was much better too new paint job, new carpets and new comfortable beds. Only downside was the slight smell of paint but on chatting to reception found out my room was only finished the previous day.

I booked this one as I wanted a base for 2 nights near London but not in the centre. It was booked before the refurbishing exercise that it is just undergoing. We expected a sofa bed and a double bed in our family room but instead got a lovely large bed and new thick pillows.  The sofa beds have now been got rid of and replaced with under the bed pull out beds. I usually make up the sofa beds myself with the linen usually left but with these new varieties I was unable to lift up the mattress and lift out the legs and no linen was provided. The cover on the mattress was severely soiled and I had to ask the already busy and multitasking receptionist…",Date of stay: October 2013,3.0
