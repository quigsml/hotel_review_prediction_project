The best thing about it is the location, as it’s literally 3 minutes away from the tube.  The bed sheets and the bathroom were dirty: spots on the duvet cover, hair all over the bathroom.  TV signal barely working, so you don’t get much for the money.  At check in you need to leave a £10 deposit, cash only, which is not mentioned anywhere. It was a problem for us, as we had no cash on us at the time at the check in and had to withdraw money on the way back at night.  Couple of food places right around the corner that are open until late.  The place is not bad, but for it’s value, could do a clean paint and some clean sheets, that’s all.",Date of stay: February 2020,2.0

Our bed was pushed into the corner which there was enough space to put in the middle of the back/headboard with another small bedside table.
