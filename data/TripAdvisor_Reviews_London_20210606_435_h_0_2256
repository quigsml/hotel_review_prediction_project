We were there to see Hamilton and it was perfect because when the show was over we just went through the station and we were home. As all london hotels, it was smaller. I have to say everyone was friendly especially the concierges and they were also helpful. But we had such an unpleasant check in experience which took almost an hour after we had come in from the pouring rain and then they gave us a crappy room so we then had to ask to change rooms very late. It very much affected our evening and our sleep for our first night. The bed was not too great either where we were and unbeknownst to us the window for the balcony was open the first night so the room was very cold.

What a difference a year makes.....  This year I did not require an overnight stay but decided to meet a client in the bar as we had done last year.  I was surprised to see that a service charge was added to my bill for making a coffee and opening a bottle of sparkling water.  When I asked for the bartender to bring it to my table (in the bar) he said no he was not allowed to.  I did email the hotel to complain and had no response.  I have worked in hospitality and found the service poor and compounded by the fact that the hotel did not respond.

I'm pained to ask this question and hopefully the Hilton watchers will react.  Does this imply that when the maid comes in when I leave she takes this top quilt and has it cleaned?  Maybe this is the new method that instead of cleaning a sheet and a quilt they now clean the quilted bedding.  Makes you wonder if this is actually done with every new occupant.

The check in process was smooth and the cookie was lovely. The suite was great, but given the location the views were not great.   Although not a problem for me as I don't drink coffee, there was a Nespresso coffee machine in the room but no pods to put in it. When I went to make a cup of tea there were no teaspoons. A quick calll to reception resolved this, but surely this is a fairly basic housekeeping issue?  I went down relatively late for breakfast and found much of the buffet quite cool.  Following breakfast I unfortunately encountered a kidney stone and needed to get to a hospital! The staff on the Concierge Desk were very helpful in getting a taxi and helping me with my luggage.

We were travelling to South London each day, but wanted to stay in London City Centre during the evenings. As such, the location, next to Victoria Station, was ideal. The choc-chip cookies we were given on arrival were also great. Even when I arrived at my room, everything was still great.   However, waking up at 3am/4am each morning was far from great preparation for the busy days ahead. The refuse & trash from the train station was collected during the early hours, and the noise from the Lorries emptying Biffa bins full of waste and bottles made sure that the recommend 8-hours of sleep was just a dream (or an interrupted dream).…",Date of stay: November 2013,2.0
