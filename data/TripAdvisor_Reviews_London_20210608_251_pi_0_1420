The building looks good and the inside facilities look modern and clean.   We was greeted by a woman upon arrival to check in. She seemed a little spacey and challenged us 3 times upon our room choice. Me and my partner stayed here and being two men seemed a little strange to her. This made us feel uncomfortable but stuck to our choice of a double room.  The room was clean and tidy and all of the provided facilities worked fine. The shower was awkward to use and has a fine line between scolding hot and warm!   The hotel is located right near a small shopping mall and a cinema which gives a lot of options on what to do.
