Unfortunately we were TRICKED  into staying in this dump.  We had booked into the LONSDALE it's so called sister hotel and upon arriving at the Lonsdales and paying they told us we had been moved!  We only made it to the reception area which was smelly and the receptionist/owner was very unfriendly.  All in all a big lesson learned, you pay peanuts you stay in a zoo!

When we walked in we were greeted! buy lurch from the adams family, but without the ability to speak English, what's up with that? The room wasn't ready and it was 1.40pm, we were ordered into the waiting room from hell, dirty walls and dirty chairs, surrounded by budget backpackers and an unearthly silence we awaited our call, honestly it was awful, we just kept looking at each other!!!! I eventually approached the desk foreigner who told me I had to wait a further 20 minutes, I told him that I would need to see the room before we paid for it and if the waiting room was a representation of the rooms then we would not be staying there.

The location is ok, but a busy bus stop outside will put noisy idling buses outside your window continuously. Honestly, walking distance to Tottenham Court Road was unnecessary as I hopped on buses anyways with a bus pass. The lobby consists of a cage with a surly, indifferent clerk. The carpets, bedding, walls and especially the toilet and showers are FILTHY.  I checked out after one night and was refused a refund, citing a 48 hour cancellation policy. The owner obviously knows everyone feels victimized by this place and takes an aggressive stance on refunds. Let this owner entrap others with his shoddy business practices.  I skipped the breakfast as the whole place just gave me the creeps.  Strangely, I…",Date of stay: February 2004,1.0

I booked it for four nights, got a confirmation and on arriving the arrogant owner bluntly told me: I have no booking. Panic, for having a very tight schedule for the coming 5 days, I asked him: perhaps you have a double room free? Of course he had, and after having seen it, I took it out of despair. A horrible experience and I wonder who is responsible for the advertising of this ghostly and dilapidated 'hotel' in which paying guests are treated like intruders. Even incoming telephone-calls were not passed on! ""Impossible"", was the only remark, I got. Don't fall a victim to the fraudulence of modern, visual advertising.

If you want to go back to England in the early 1900's this is the place for you. At least that is the last time besides a brief time in the early 60's which is probably the last time they cleaned and remodeled. We viewed the rooms before paying (thank God) and were greeted to filthy carpets, drapes hanging off the rods, toilets with urine -- you get the idea. It is in an ideal location and we walked half a block to the Marlboro by Radisson. Great value, clean and a wonderful staff and breakfast included.

Dirty, stained sheets and bedspread. No rubbish/trash can in the room. No complimentary coffee or tea. Carpet was dirty. The showers were dirty. Shower heads were broken and water went everywhere because in the one showers there should have been a sliding door but it was just open. I know someone went into my room while I was gone because I found an interior window open that I'd closed before leaving. The room was also cold. No heat on during the night. Couldn't eat breakfast because it wasn't served until after I had to leave and I was afraid it would be just as bad. All rooms are smoking rooms as well.

I have travelled fairly extensively in the last 10 years, throughout Africa and Asia and I can honestly say that as a student ten years ago I stayed at smarter guesthouses in the more squalid parts of Nairobi.  The bedspread in the double room (which incidentally had no shower or loo - an unwelcome surprise) had a blood stain on it the size of my forearm. When I turned the bed down the blanket had an obscene amount of body hair matted into it.  Both my girlfriend and I slept with jeans and sweatshirts on, so disgusting was the state of the room.
