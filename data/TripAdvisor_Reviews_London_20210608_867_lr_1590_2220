Its not modern and glam but its comfy , clean and warm,ideal on a cold Jan visit.

There,s a big bar ,which is open till late if you are a resident , and its quite pleasant. Breakfast is pretty basic especially continental.

We chose the Tavistock at the recommendation of some other Americans who were looking for a good deal.  Since we were living in England at the time and had been traveling extensively in Europe, we were accustomed to the differences between lower-priced American hotels and European hotels of the same price range. The European budget hotels tend to have smaller rooms and be more basic than you would find in the USA. Now, I know this is a sweeping…",None,3.0

The lobby is art deco and was always peaceful. Street noises never bothered me (but I have lived in NYC). For a budget two star hotel at a great price (through British Airways), it surpassed expectations. My clean single room was good sized and had plenty of storage and floor space. Good lighting, too. Decor is simple but cheerful. Carpet could do with replacing. TV big and worked well. Plumbing was fine and plenty of hot water for the deep bath/shower. You can borrow a hair dryer or converter plug from housekeeping. Bring your own kleenex.My adult son arrived a few hours after I…",None,4.0

We've previously stayed at everything from b & bs to budget to 4 star hotels in London and found the Tavistock a decent if not luxurious place to stay. The location is conveniently close to a tube station, small restaurants and stores.Our room was clean and comfortable and everything worked, unlike the experience other reviewers seem to have had. The view was limited to an air shaft, but hey, we were only in the room to sleep.The breakfasts were included with the room and consisted of a buffet with a choice of hot and cold foods. We liked the ham and the porridge especially.Altogether, we found the Tavistock several steps up from the ghastly Royal National Hotel at the other end of the block and worth the money.",None,4.0

We hot footed it round to the Tavistock, (where we had spent millenium new year as a couple) and were treated like royalty in comparison to our previous abode. The room we were given was specificlly intended for parents with a toddeler, with lots of room for running round !  We had a lovely time.",None,5.0

Even though I was aware that it was a 'budget hotel' I was not prepared for the run down quality of the place.  The staff was not too friendly, bordering on rude actually. The room was run down, the lights didn't all work, the toilet didn't flush and my bed broke when I sat on it! Since the toilet didn't flush we changed rooms which seemed to be a bother to the staff! So when we finally found a new room the heat was blasted on (must have been 40 degrees Celsius in the room) and couldn't be turned off. At that point we were so tired we took it and opened the window wide. They had to call a plumber who came in the morning and finally turned it off.  Over all a disappointment.",None,1.0

Contrary to the comments posted by other travellers, I found the hotel service terribly poor. Most of the facilities in the room did not work properly, including the door lock, tap, lightings, etc. When I asked the hotel staff to fix the door lock, I was told that it was ""designed"" in such a way that it could not be locked for fire precaution purpose!!!!! Just can't believe a staff in the hospitality industry told such a lie to customer.Most of the staff is rude and impolite. Do not choose this hotel unless you want to have some unpleasant experience in London.",None,1.0

The first thing you see when you arrive is the lovely Tavistock Square across the street. Then you are greeted in the charming deco style lobby. I'll admit, I was a little disappointed when I first saw our room. It seemed so small and had twin beds! But it didn't take long to get over that initial disappointment. We weren't here to hang out in the room, so who cares if it's small? Besides, the view overlooking the square was beautiful. I read another review here that said the street noise was too loud. We didn't have that problem at all. We slept with the windows wide open and our sleep was never disturbed.The location is great, just two blocks from the Russell Square tube station. Of course, if the tube isn't for you, it's very easy to catch a…",None,4.0

It was just what my wife and I wanted--centrally located, clean and quiet, inexpensive hotel.  Most of the people staying at the Tavistock were ""older"" and were not the backpacking hoards we've encountered at other hotels in Bloomsbury.  Not as upscale as the Kenilworth and Marlborough where we've stayed before, and certainly a notch above the Royal National where we've also stayed.  The Tavistock is perfect if you plan to do a lot of sightseeing during the day and just want a place where you can crash at night.  My only complaint? If you forget your room voucher you can forget about getting into breakfast.  All in all, the Tavistock exceeded our expectations. ",None,4.0

Each visit was motivated by a) the cost and b) the location.  The Tavistock is the kind of place that you stay at when the expense account isn't covering the cost and you aren't on your dream vacation.  The beauty of this hotel is that you don't go home with a financial hangover even though you stayed at a place that is close to much of the London action.  The hotel is only 2 blocks from the Russell Square  Tube stop.  This is part of the Piccadilly line, which runs to popular places such as Covent Garden, Leicester Square, and Piccadilly Circus.  Here are the caveats:  1) Request a room away from the street.  The traffic never stops and the windows seal about as well as a sandwich bag on its…",None,2.0
