The staff knew we were there only to shower. Surprisingly 3 hours before check out they removed our personal belongings. When we went to shower they gave us some nonsense excuse of what went wrong not a hint of apology nor any attempt to go into a diffuse the situation mode to make up for their cock up. As if nothing happened. The so called person in charge had zero communication skills and it was only when I promoted her to delay our check out that she said we can have an extra hour! Hotel is quiet and she could have easily extend a good will gesture by delaying check out for a few hours knowing the reasons why we were using the hotel. We stayed in 5 star hotels in peak seasons abroad and always real hotel professional accommodate delayed check outs . Not at Southgate Premier Inn!

I then sat there for 45 minutes before order was taken I then waited another 40 minutes on top before any sign of starter after I had complained twice.Then the starter had no red onion marmalade and no rocket just some side salad.Then pizza had no chicken and I asked for 6 toppings only got 4 and supposedly extra pepperoni to replace missing chicken but this was sparse to say the least so finally finished eating at 10:15pm so 2 hours of my life I won’t get back.I stay in a lot of premiere inns and normally favour the thyme restaurants but this is one of the worsts and they need to sort it out.,Date of stay: March 2018,1.0

Hotel was immaculate and the staff were friendly and helpful. Parking cost £10 for 24 hours and is payable when you check in. Plenty of eating places nearby, we went to Nando’s on the evening which is literally across the road. The breakfast was tasty and plenty of choice, great for kids. Overall a great stay and would definitely recommend 😀",Date of stay: February 2018,5.0

Took a while to find it as its behind a youth club building opposite the southgate station. Parking is £10 per night and it appears to be very insecure.  Staff are nice.  Typical generic Thyme menu, the same as all the other thymes I've stayed in recently. Please please please expand the menu. It's as dull as dishwater. Thyme used to have some interesting food on offer, especially the burger collections.  ",Date of stay: February 2018,4.0

Newly opened so facilities are very good. Staff we met were so pleasant, helpful and efficient. Slight gripe - you have to pay extra for car parking. £10 per 24 hours is steep for North London [not central London]. We were staying for a number of nights, and possibly would have had to extend stay further. This flat rate for parking begins to add up and so erode the value of booking Premier Inn...........perhaps a sliding scale for staying more than one night?",Date of stay: February 2018,4.0

Parking is straight next to hotel and there are plenty of spaces. Parking is £10 per night. Restaurant is spacious, there is no alcohol on pump it is all bottled.   Staff members were keen to help and were helpful. Only issue is that many items in the restaurant were out of stock, however the hotel had only been open a few days and teething problems are to be expected.   Recommendation for resolving this is telling people when sitting down what is out of stock rather than letting people order, then returning to them to say none is left, and then letting them re order something else to then come back and say that's out of stock too.   But overall it's a small issue that I'm sure will be resolved.   Plenty of alternative places to eat and visit…",Date of stay: February 2018,4.0
