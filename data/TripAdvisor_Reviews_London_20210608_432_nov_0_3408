Very helpful staff, and nice room.  However there were faults - there was a woman's hair in the bathroom  - disturbing during these safety concious times.  Also the milk cartons provided had gone off and were totally sour.  Lastly the TV kept turning off for no reason.  I let management know in the morning (again very polite and helpful) and asked for some sort of recompense - they said next time they would do me a preferential rate. However when the time came, I was offered a rate only £15 cheaper than the Booking.com site - I would have expected my complaints to be taken a bit more seriously. I booked elsewhere for a cheaper rate.  It might be head office policy so I'm not blaming the staff themselves, who were good.

I booked a Premium Executive room as it was not much more than their ""basic"" room. It was clean and had comfortable bedding. However I felt a little disappointed overall.

Located in London and close to main attractions and a 5 minute walk to the underground, this hotel makes it for a perfect stay without having to be cramped in the city center.  The rooms are small and in a massive building, typical for London. The bathroom is very clean but the higher you stay the worst it gets to get water pressure on your shower.  The breakfast buffet is great and something not to be missed as it has a huge variety of choice. However, it can get quiet crowded due to the size of the hotel.

On check in we were upgraded to an executive suite on the 8th floor. I think the difference is you receive robes & slippers, complementary bottles of water & use of a nespresso machine. Bed was big! & very comfortable. No complaints about anything in the room. We didn't use any of the other facilities as this was just a base for us. My only 'complaint' is the price of car parking at £1.50 per hour if you're a guest. A very reasonable rate for London but I perhaps feel is should have a cap on the total you could be charged.

I am English and we shared a room for two nights. The reason this hotel was chosen was she was joining a European coach trip from here. I was appalled that this hotel is marked four star. My share of the bill for two nights was £191 which did NOT include breakfast. Breakfast was an additional £17.50. That is an extremely expensive meal!! My first impression of the hotel was not a good one. The lift that went up to the reception was dirty with pop bottles on the floor. When we got to the room the carpet was filthy. All of the carpets in the hotel needed a good scrub. Unless you are very rich and don't mind dirty floors then I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all.

Just before leaving on our trip, I'd read two in a row bad reviews so what a pleasant shock to see a lovely hotel with the best breakfast (included) on our tour.  There were 3 of us in a room and I slept on the pull out couch which wasn't bad.  The hotel itself was lovely.  Wish we'd hit the gift shop when it was open, really unique things.  The location was good for pubs, to which my 2 daughters and I were able to walk.  Bathroom was good sized and as to the noise factor some mentioned, we were on the 4th floor overlooking an outside area and there was some noise there but not really late noise.  All the hotels where we stayed had thin walls, I think you need to expect that in advance.  The pictures on Novotel's website do it justice.  It was the most amazing…",Date of stay: August 2014,4.0

Ours was set out as a family room, it was very tight for space, but we half expected that, what we didn't expect was the strong smell of moth balls on entry, the stained carpet, and the tired decor.

I booked on the Internet for a room with a double, a single and a sofa bed. It turns out that, in the room I was given, the Sofa Bed WAS the single bed.
