","So unfortunately the website we used to book our room malfunctioned and gave us a double room instead of a twin and so when we arrived to the hotel the twin bed had no sheets on it. When i spoke to the staff member about this she rudely informed me i had booked the wrong room and then refused to make eye contact with me. I was so shocked by being spoken to like this and then completely ignored i went back to my room. Unfortunately due severe fatigue, migraine and other issues due to disabilities i cut my losses at this point and me and my sister decided to shste the double bed.. Even though the twin  and double room cost the same and it would not have taken her much time to put some sheets on the bed. When entering the hotel she did not ask for any proof of our stay during covid restrictions which i find troubling but i shrugged it off at this point. Later that night we were awakened by loud music coming from the room above ours and and loud footsteps and unfortunately previously my sister witnessed someone dropping illegal substances in the hotel. That night we barely slept due to the noise and the fact we had to share a bed. I was not well rested for my hospital appointment the day after and with countless disabilities, i wad hugely symptomatic through the stress off the experience and can easily say i will never stay here again and could not believe the way i was. spoken to and the lack of guidelines being followed which meant loud music and  drug use was able to be used. I informed premier onn on Facebook and they said its been noted but did not offer me any reimbursement or discount. Its awful customer service.

Location was good with easy access to the City. Yeah Brixton has that reputation that seems to loom over its head, but there was honestly nothing about the place that made me feel unsafe. And the Bowie memorials and art were a nice touch as well. Nice homage to the chap. The rooms were up to date with some nice little touches including a modern feel wardrobe that was a double open ended space for jackets and shirts etc, a big comfy bed, nice en suite bathroom, and funky purple moodlighting above the headboard of the bed. That appealed to me because I can't sleep in pitch black. Staff were very nice and helpful. Absolutely no complaints at all, everything was perfect for what I wanted.

This room is right next to the night club, which thuds music until 3am. We asked to change room, however the hotel was full.
