Booked for a room with single bed but assigned a basement room with double bed which was spacious for a single guest. Comfortable bedding. Heating operated well. Clean kettle and teabags / coffee provided. Best thing is to watch TV comfortably on bed. Downsides were very weak and unstable wifi and no views in basement rooms. Desk too small. Bathroom clean but way to small. Had to squeeze myself out of shower. Will only come again (because fairly cheap price for London budget hotels) for staying overnight if I know I do not have to use the shower.,Date of stay: October 2020,2.0

It is extremely good for the price and the breakfast is excellent. The room that we stayed in was clean and there were good bathroom facilities with a warm shower. The only down side is that the stairs could be challenging especially for someone with a disability, even more so if you are on the top floor as the stairs get very narrow and steep meaning that it is difficult to carry suitcases up and down them.

To be fair, it was better than sleeping at the train station but pretty basic. My ground floor room was big, clean bedding and bathroom although bathroom tiles/shower screen stained. I fully understand the heat was not something that could be helped and I did find a fan in the cupboard.

Great location, walking distance to Covent Gardens and Soho.  Small rooms, old-fashioned (squeaky floorboards!) but very clean and good value considering price.  Receptionists extremely friendly and helpful.  Breakfast 7.30-9.30 but don't risk arriving just before 9.30.  We were presented with stone cold sausages, no apology when we pointed this out - blunt excuse from waitress ""we arrived at 9.30!!""  Problem sorted by microwaving to 1000C!  You might need to check with reception latest time for a hot breakfast as rest on offer very paltry.  However overall would stay again considering price, location and reception staff.  Might swap breakfast for nice coffee and croissant nearby in one of the many cafes..",Date of stay: April 2011,3.0

The family was delightful, very friendly & helpful. The location, Cartwright Gardens, is fantastic, charming & fairly quiet, with a great Indian restaurant nearby that is open late. The front door was kept locked & you had to be let in & out, but I'm not sure why as the neighborhood seemed safe to me. I made the mistake of booking a basement-floor room -- all that was left so I was happy to get it -- but the closeness of Euston station means that you can hear trains/tube running underneath the ground (this would be the case for any of the hotels in this area I presume). I couldn't hear any outside noise so I'd guess other rooms in the hotel would be quieter. The decor, carpet, bathroom etc. was dated…",Date of stay: October 2010,4.0

As others have said, it's fine for a (relatively) cheap London hotel, with a good location in Bloomsbury, friendly staff and a reasonable (not brilliant) breakfast included in the price. Our room was clean and neat, but far too hot - we had to switch the radiators off and leave the windows open for a couple of hours to get it down to a sensible temparature. But at least we had the option of doing that, unlike the many chain hotels where you can't control heating or ventilation.  The main problem was that we were woken constantly through the night by the noise - both from the resident in the room above stumbling in (and tripping over the bedside table from the sound of it), and of the person in the next room who kept coming and going in the small hours,…",Date of stay: January 2011,3.0

That said, everything was clean and the staff were friendly. I was in a basement room and the noise of tube trains underneath was very noticeable - something I have not noticed in other hotels on this road. Whilst Cartwright Gardens has a good mix of well priced hotels and is well placed for Euston/Kings Cross, I would suggest trying one of the others on this road before the Avonmore.",Date of stay: November 2010,2.0

But the truth is its just okay.   The location is probably the best thing about the hotel. Our room was one of the basement rooms and it had a dark and dingy feeling about it. The decor was very dated, and the future was mismatched and old. It was however clean. The windows were very thin, and I couldnt get much sleep becuase the room was so cold, and the light keep coming through the gap in the door.   The shower was a nightmare, couldnt get the water temperature right at all. I almost ended up with third degree burns because the water was so hot.

The staff are flippin lovely, the slightly camp fella on reception always had a smile on his face and a genuinely interesting line of chat for us. The foreign lady who ran the breakfast room was smart, alert and fairly efficient.
