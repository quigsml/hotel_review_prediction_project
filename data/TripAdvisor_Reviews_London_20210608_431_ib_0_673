This is difficult for the hotel cleaning staff to fix as the UHT milk does not have a use by date on it so they have no means of checking whether the milk is ok for customers to use.

GET A CHEF! How can you expect one employee to undergo all of these roles. I had to each my fish and chips with a tea spoon because no knife and fork got offered to me and I simply could not find another member of staff to retrieve cutlery. Would not return.

I have been contacting the hotel since last 2 weeks, they keep telling me that I made 2 bookings so they charged me twice in full. I said to them the simpliest way is to check your system and see how many check-in made during the stay, and you will find only one person checked-in in one room. Even though the Ibis's system got wrong and charged me twice, for one duplicated booking room you will found no-one checked in and stayed during the stay, and Ibis should only charge 10% if no-one checked in after the booking against their policy. They even don't reply to my email now and I am still waiting... Really bad service and helpless staff.",Date of stay: April 2010,2.0

An average type of hotel, reasonably priced etc. But the my stay at the Stratford Ibis was terrible!!! I was doing the London Triathlon and has a really bad nights sleep. It was hot and I thought I'd put on the air conditioning at 1.30am. My night of a peaceful sleep was over! The aircon was noisy and let off smoky air that smelled like tobbaco, I was choking! It was noisy outside as I could hear people shouting and arguing (but not Ibis's fault).  The shower is in the bedroom in a separate cabin that was unclean. The rooms smelled of smoke. As a non-smoking hotel it's strange how we had to change rooms three times until we found a room that didn't smell.  I had no choice in the morning but to focus on the race.

The hotel was a fairly average IBIS - nothing special but, as a previous reviewer has said, it did what it's there for. Short stays in an efficient manner. For instance, the rooms are reasonably large for a London hotel and in that respect this hotel is good value.   What I took exception to was hearing at 9 on a Sunday morning drilling coming from somewhere nearby. Luckily my partner and I had to be away early. If I'd been wanting a typical Sunday morning lie-in I would have been really angry.   As it was, I thought I'd mention it on checkout, as I assumed the management would appreciate a warning, so they could tell the workman to stop until a reasonable hour.

We were interested in sightseeing London, and found this hotel a bit far from the centre. Over 30 minutes on the tube. We were also always looking out on our back when returning late to the hotel, because the surrounding of Ibis has lots of imigrants. The easyest way to get to and from the tube to the hotel is crossing the Stratford Mall, at any time of day and night, but at night all the shops are closed. Still, there was always someone siting or browsing stores' windows and we were always on allert mode. There was also lots of construction going on the tube/ train station, as the 2012 olympics will take place near‚Ä¶",Date of stay: July 2009,3.0

Our only gripe was that there is no parking whatsoever and the receptionist was vague about where we could park.  Either on street meter parking some way from the hotel or in the nearby shopping centre.  It was a bit a a drag to have to drive round late at night to find somewhere to leave the car.  For this reason, we wouldn't choose this Ibis again.  The only other thing was the fire alarm going off at 3 in the morning.  Not the best night's sleep!

However, the promotion was gone and now it costs 58 pounds per night. That's a bit expensive as breakfast is not included. If your budget is not tight, it's really a nice place to stay, especially for businessman. The environment outside is nice as well. And it's close to the tube station , just around 7 minutes walk. There is a shopping mall nearby as well. Good location and excellent accomodation. Recommended! ",Date of stay: October 2006,5.0
