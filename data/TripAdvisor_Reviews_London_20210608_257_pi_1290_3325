Clean and well equipped as you would expect.  The reason why the score is marked down to 3 is because of the exorbitant pricing they put on the hotel specifically during the RideLondon cycle event.  The stay here cost £300 for two nights, in 2016 the price is going up to £325! Check saturday and sunday any other weekend and it is half the price.  I understand about supply and demand, but they are taking massive liberties knowing they are located right near the start line, and doubling the price for this particular weekend is, quite frankly, offensive.

The hotel is also right next to the Westfield mall, which means lots of eating options and a Waitrose right close by as well.

Best location, best value for money, best quality, best service - best overall. The views are also magnificent. The rate can be high, because demand is obviously high. But you can save a lot on transport, which is generally considered expensive in London, because the hotel is so well connected. There's even a mini-cab office just next door, or you can wheel your suitcases over to Stratford or Stratford International (also served by the DLR - and you're just a few minutes a way from St Pancras ).

I have to say I was not expecting to have such a great view of the Olympic venue (at night it's spectacular). The food was great, breakfast always a joy. The problems I could actually pick out would be the reception being on the first floor, with the lifts awfully slow it sometimes takes forever to get to your floor, there maybe also lots of people so it is advised to have breakfast early as possible. The last problem I can think of would the smell of he corridor, whether it is anti funghi or what it is quite potent. I would still recommend this place to anyone, especially if you LOVE shopping!
