We booked it, everything seemed fine. We got there, to see a letter on the door that said if you've booked a stay, to go to another hotel instead. A man came out and rudely told us to go to another hotel, when we questioned him he pointed his finger to the street and said ""it's a road away!""   We dragged our luggage to a hotel a road away (which was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, in my life!) I am talking to the comparison website and my bank to get a full refund. Obviously this hotel and the other hotel are in business together. We should have gotten a call or email to say that we wouldn't be staying in this hotel, but some dirty studio apartments a road away. If we had known we wouldn't have been staying in THIS hotel, we would have gone somewhere elsewhere. They should NOT have been on the comparison website, taking in bookings, taking in money, to not offer a service they promised. We paid extra for breakfast, but the place they moved us to did not offer breakfast so we paid extra for nothing and had to leave to buy more breakfast elsewhere.  This completely ruined our trip to London, and I highly advise everyone to call up and check if they will be staying in this hotel, or the dirty studios we were put in. All I want is a refund. You could not pay me to stay again.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2021,1.0

There was no Covid cases at Queen‚Äôs Park hotel as this is a common theme if you look through Google reviews. If they had that many Covid cases then Boris needs informing as this is clearly the hot spot! Staff are rubbish, hotel is below par, dirty and tv doesn‚Äôt work.

Like I said before it is what it is.  A basic hotel in a great location for seeing London.  This time we got the 5th floor which I thought would be great and the room itself was small but fine.  HOWEVER, I don't care what star of hotel you are in, basic cleanliness is a must.  Nobody wants to come into a room & bathroom that hasn't been cleaned properly.  On arrival at our room I noticed the shower had a hair in it.  Upon closer inspection there was actually 5 hairs all left in the shower and a slightly stained hand towel.

I was familiar with this area of London already, so that was one reason I chose this hotel.  The other reason was it was considerably lower-priced & still within my budget.  The A/C came in handy, as there were very hot days with no breeze through the small window.  The room was very small, but typical for London & big enough for just myself.  Staff were nice.  At first I was confused why the electricity wasn't working, but they sent a maintenance man up to my room to check things & explain; within minutes.
