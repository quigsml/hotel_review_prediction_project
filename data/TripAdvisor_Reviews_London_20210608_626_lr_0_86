The reception was small and within the narrow corridor that has a full length mirror on the wall, local information and leads to the stairs.  The room was small and compact with a standard double bed and a large wall mounted mirror with a hairdryer fixed next to it. There was also an armchair by the window, a bedside cupboard in need of replacing with a lamp on, a small single wardrobe, a wall mounted fan, a large wall mounted flat-screen TV and a shelf with tea/coffee facilities on it. The bathroom was also very small but looked recently refurbished compared to the room. It had a single sink vanity unit with a small shower that had a double shower head. The view was of the main road. The hotel was in a great location around the corner from shops, bars & restaurants and within walking distance to Paddington station that was no more than 10 mins walk away.…",Date of stay: June 2020,3.0

We booked it as the location is ideal, we were on a budget and it got ok reviews on booking.com.  Firstly the location is excellent,  it is around the corner from paddington underground, lots of bars and restaurants and shops. Very convenient.  We could also walk to hyde park and to oxford st. The bedding and towels were clean. Negatives are probably too many to list... when we arrived three people were standing  blocking the door smoking, nice first impression. The ""reception"" is up one flight of stairs, it's more like a little hutch you stand at the door and you're given your key. Our room was at the top, no elevator but that was fine only the stair cases carpet was actually filthy and covered in stains.  Our room door was damaged looking with a key stuck in the bottom lock. The room was small which we had expected so that was grand. The walls were grubby and stained with something that had poured down this was also on the back of the bathroom door. There was a small table at the end of the bed with a tray for tea/coffee and kettle. This was filthy! The table was not wiped in a long time. The water in the shower was hit and miss, it was hard to have a constant warm shower it went up and down or else stayed cold. I have to say I was expecting more, I had read reviews and thought it would be grand but I cannot describe how  dirty everything was around the room we really did get the yuck feeling. We would never again go back! …",Date of stay: February 2020,1.0

I arrived at 11am - very early and unable to check in, which wasn't a problem for me.I was going to an event in London and was able to leave my bag with them until I checked in on my arrival at 10pm.  Check in (even at this silly o'clock) was swift and simple.    The room was nice, compact - not enough room to swing a cat, but I didn't bring one to swing.  It served the purpose - I needed a reasonably priced bed for the night, I got one.  It was clean, the bathroom was clean, the towels were clean.  All good.

From the start . We arrived late one evening, greeted by who I think is the owner, however he didn’t have all that much to say. I paid and was given the room key. When entering the “ family room “ we were faced with 2 beds, 1 double 1 single, this isn’t ideal for 2 adults and 2 children however it is usable. The room itself was very small , there are tea and coffee making facilities. The shower room / bathroom was very small also. On a positive note the bedding was clean and felt of a good quality. There is an oscillating fan in the room , that was handy, there were cracks in the ceiling above the double bed . The breakfast was ok, cold juices etc however the yoghurts were room temp , the staff didn’t really speak to us. I personally wouldn’t want to stay there again however if you literately just want somewhere to get your head down it will do the job.

I booked a room at the Classic Hyde Park Hotel as the prices were good and it is well located.  I reached it by bus easily even though I arrived pretty late.

On the down side, the room maybe 3m * 4m including the en suite bathroom, the bed is most of the room, offers instant coffee and cable TV with Wifi (if purchased).  A good location and not too noisy even though it's close to Paddington, quite expensive for what it is (£500 for 3 nights) but one thing that may put the average person off is they do not have safes in the rooms and they don't offer a safe in the main reception either.

You were allowed to keep bags there once checked out while you are out and about but be aware that they are not kept in a separate room so you are leaving them at your own risk.

Duvet covers were soiled, sheets were soiled. Carpet, dont even get me started!  The beds were in front of the windows with high head boards and the radiators were behind the beds.   The receptionist? couldnt understand us (we were speaking English) We complained about all this and he offered to show us another room,  he opened the door to the other room only to find that it was occupied.  So he didnt even know there was someone staying in this room.  I would not advise anyone to stay here.  It was so bad, we left with no refund.",Date of stay: May 2013,1.0
