Should you want a friendly reception and a warm welcome, a clean environment and quality for your money plus a very safe and secure quiet place in the middle of a very busy intersection then this is the hotel for you. Right outside is a big bus terminal, a underground station, a rail station and not far from here a ferry station. Plenty of restaurants for take always or coffees hops for a cuppa. The beautiful of this place is a minute outside of the main door and you can have a nice peaceful fresh walk by the river ( keep your mask on, safety first ). If you love design like I do then the spiral staircase going from the ground floor to the reception downstairs is a bonus. The people at reception are so welcoming they beg you to come anytime of the day or night of you need anything. A diplomatic and informative and friendly bunch indeed. Say hi to everyone specially Malik and Ayela ( oops might be misspelled ) and the rest of the troopers like Cassandra, Ash and so on. Travelling for work nowadays are depressing and stressful so come unwind in their environment, it’s therapeutic to say the least.

Still trying to work out what was super about it. Could hear every car/train passing outside. Breakfast box was given to me when I checked in at 1800 ish. Milk and orange juice(which had no straw) were warm by the morning. Coffee machine was adequate to say the least and the pods were unmarked so it was a guess as to which one was decaf. And no bottled water in the room either. I also think there was a rhino in the room upstairs could hear their every footstep. No options or information given on where I could get hot food either.

Was offered key to another room which was worse still.No other room available locally so stayed but spent minimum time in sweat box. Slept poorly and checked out early.

Also with a little flexibility of dates and booking well ahead good prices, for London, can often be found here.  Whilst I accept that this is a budget hotel, I have always thought that the standard rooms, whilst bright, clean and relatively comfortable are completely lacking in basic storage facilities. I'd actually made up my mind that I wasn't going to stay in a Travelodge ever again and choose Premier Inn or other more upmarket hotels instead.

While it's probably one of the cheapest of the chains, it's very stripped down in terms of decor and style.  But if you're looking for a reasonable night's sleep in the heart of this action packed area, then the Travellodge is a reasonable bet.  Bed was passably comfortable, the air conditioning a little 'buzzy', and the only way to control the temperature.  However given that the front overlooks a bus station (the back overlooks a railway line) it's surprisingly well insulated from external noise.  Get a high number room to get as far as way from the lift shaft as possible if you're keen to minimise internal noise.

We were really happy when we found this hotel which had good reviews and was in a relatively central location for a low price.  All in all this was a positive experience and a good base to explore London. There are a few points worth noting: -Location - there's not much to do in Vauxhall but there are buses, trains and the tube literally outside the hotel door so it's very easy to get around. The Eye, aquarium and London Dungeon are within walking distance and also possibly Buckingham Palace if you cross the bridge (we didn't walk there from the hotel so not sure how long it is.)  -Rooms - Our double room was compact but not too small, we had…",Date of stay: September 2014,3.0

The location is really superb for public transport, its opposite a bus terminus and adjacent to the tube station. A Tesco express is across the road for night time sweets too.   Only one slight negative is that the windows were shut and don't open however the air conditioning made up for it.  We felt very safe in this hotel as the key was needed to gain access to each level before entering the hallway.
