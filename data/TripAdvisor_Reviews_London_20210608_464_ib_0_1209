I was in Greenwich doing some essential work on a film set at the time, I thought an BnB may be more efficient, however, after staying at the Ibis for the first couple of nights, I was immediately charmed by the extremely friendly and accommodating staff who went above and beyond to make my stay as comfortable as possible. During the day I had the privilege of dealing with Raluca, who gave me very well informed advice on the local area as well as making sure I had no issues.  The night porter, Randy was a very charming individual who helped me with a printing emergency and was extremely accommodating throughout my stay. I also spoke to one of the managers, Victorine, who was also nothing but patient and helpful. The way these staff members went above and beyond the call of duty helped make my stay very comfortable and I will definitely be booking with the ibis again next time I’m in Greenwich.

Any slight anxiety soon resolved by the friendly welcome from reception and the sight of our clean and quiet room. Hand sanitiser points by the entrance and the lift; face coverings requested in public areas. Our room was described as 'overlooking a courtyard' which turned out to be several air-conditioner outlets and a brick wall! However there are plenty of superb views elsewhere in Greenwich so we were happy to trade  beauty for quietness. Facilities in the room are on the minimal side: wall-mounted soap dispensers and cramped toilet; kettle but no crockery (although this is a temporary anti-Covid measure and paper cups are available from reception). The bed was very comfortable. For the price (a bargain for London) we were very happy. The only minor niggle was the carpet which was stained and 'tired'. We did not have breakfast (we were offered a package of cereal and croissants before 09.00 or the option of a cooked breakfast in Café Rouge afterwards) because we preferred to find our own locally: there are plenty of other cafés and restaurants within five minutes' walk. The location is ideal: just off the major road into the town centre and five minutes from the mainline station, midway between two DLR stations and near plenty of buses (and the riverboat pier). The town centre, Greenwich Market and the Old Naval College complex are gems which are probably best seen now when many tourists are staying away.…",Date of stay: September 2020,4.0

Staff were friendly and approachable and mostly happy to help. We had breakfast in Cafe Rogue which promised a hot option and a selection of continental items. We were offered a croissant and nothing else. Breakfast was average (not bad, nothing amazing!) and we went elsewhere on the second day.   Early check in was available and we were given plenty of information on COVID procedures. However our rooms were cleaned on the second morning despite being told they wouldn’t be.

It is also on a good bus route to the O2 and near to shops, restaurants, Greenwich Market and the tourist sights of Greenwich.    The hotel's public areas are a little shabby and if you want a late-night drink, it is served in reception as there is no separate bar.  Our room was small, but clean and adequate for a few nights' stay.  The adjacent Café Rouge provides a good choice of nice evening meals.    The main problem is with breakfast.  A voucher is obtained at reception and you have to decide at that point whether you would like the continental or full English breakfast.  You then present the voucher in the Café Rouge where the breakfast service is not very attentive.  The continental…",Date of stay: January 2009,3.0

In point of fact I found the staff on reception both helpful and courteous. The room was as basic as you'd expect from an Ibis, but clean and in good condition.  The late night bar had a pretty limited choice (G&T without lemon just isn't the same), but there were a number of pubs nearby with good atmosphere. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance - definitely choose one of them for breakfast rather than the overpriced CafeRouge.    All in all, OK for the price.",Date of stay: October 2008,4.0

To be fair the good points are that it is greatly located and is in easy reach of the DLR, the o2 and the decor isn't too bad.  However, when you actually enter the hotel everything goes bad. the receptions on the front desk are unhelpful and don't explain anything. When you get to the room it is very basic and the bed is like concrete. There isn't a hairdryer either. If you want privacy then go elsewhere, as the cleaner barged in the door as I was dressing. My boyfriend and i thought we'd use the room service to have some dinner, but room service doesnt exist there. You are told to wait (somewhere, have no idea where) and the food ""won't be long"".

However, I couldn't have been more wrong. I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel considering how cheap it was at £55 p/n. Last MInute.com classed this as a 2* hotel. I was expecting a dump, but as long as it was clean I'd be happy as I was just staying for one night.  The room itself was a decent size. It appeared to be newly refurbished. The bathroom was very modern and though very small it was bright and airy.  Our room overlooked the Thames and we could see the O2 Arena clearly. The room was spotless and we were impressed at the choice of tv channels and tea and coffee making facilities for a 2*.

The location is fantastic - a 2 min walk from the park in Greenwich, the DLR, the Cutty Sark (although it is being refurbished at the moment and is totally covered up), the pier for boat trips to the city, Greenwich market, etc. The hotel is quite cheap in comparison to other hotels in the area. That's about it on the positives - now the negatives... We had made our reservation using the hotel's website.

Rooms are small, basic, but clean and tidy with good use of space. The location of this hotel is great for exploring Greenwich and the Cutty Sark area, and it's proximity to Greenwich train station means it serves as a useful base for going further afield in the City. There are plenty of places to eat nearby, and the hotel is connected to a Cafe Rouge. Breakfast in Cafe Rouge wa s nice but grossly overpriced. The foreign receptionists at the hotel were clearly a little overworked and stressed, but they were polite and did everything they could to help us.

Luckily my fears were un-founded.  Upon arrival, I was pleased to find a very clean & uncluttered reception area. The receptionist was from abroad but spoke good enough English & was polite enough. Ok, like the previous review says, the receptionist did answer the phone whilst at the same time dealing with my check in - but it wasn't a problem - I was checking into a 2star hotel not the Ritz afterall.  When I got to my room, again I was pleased to find it very clean.

First things first, the location of the hotel is very handy for Greenwich high street and the Cutty Sark, and that is it's only good point.  When you get to the hotel there will be no parking available within the hotel compound - as we were advised by the receptionist that the staff park there.  There is a Pay and Display car park directly behind the hotel but as with everything in London, it is not cheap.

I was hugely dissapointed when I arived the first night. One of the reasons I booked this hotel is because I wanted to be close to the metro (DLR/Tube) and the reseptionist told me it was a ""2 minute walk"". It ended up being more like 10 minutes which is very inconvinient for some people who might be lugging their suitcases and who might be wearing high heels to work. The rooms resemble someones cold and dark basement. As soon as I opened the room door there was a very foul odour that one might expect at a hostel and not a 3 star hotel.
