My partner and I have had next to no sleep because the room has been over 20 degrees warm all night. There is no air conditioning, one small fan and no phone to call reception to ask for another fan. When needing to cool down, I went to the tap to splash some cold water on my face to find that the tap was also broken. This has been an unpleasant stay. I know the weather outside isn't something the hotel can control but all rooms should have air conditioning or be attempting to cool the rooms in a better way. Sleeping in a room this hot must be violating some health and safety rule! We will be putting in a formal complaint.

Room was very basic (expected considered this is a travellodge) but clean.   As with any hotel in London it was very expensive and I think paying over £100/night is a bit steep considering the hotel (this was reinforced when a friend who was travelling Thailand stayed in a 5* hotel for £90/night and even stayed in a hotel for £2/night that could have given this hotel a run for its money). Having said that, it's in a good location, few mins walk from Bethnal Green underground station, and all hotels in London are overpriced. ",Date of stay: June 2016,3.0
