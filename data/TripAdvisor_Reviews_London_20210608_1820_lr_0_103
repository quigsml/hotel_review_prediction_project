When we arrived, we were immediately upgraded to a larger room which was more like a suite then a double bedroom! For the price we paid you will struggle to find accommodation as good as this in East London, (we paid £194). I think the reviews reflect old management and older rooms which are still in the process of being updated that some guests have stayed in.   However, food for thought for management is that: The rooms don't appear to be sound proofed, this could be looked into. Not all the plug sockets worked which is just me being fussy as I like to have my phone next to my bed But most importantly, your reception staff don't pick up the phone when people call and when they do, I just got ""hello"" and a very monotone and unhelpful conversation. Either hire new staff who care about first impressions or offer some training to them as they're not helping with resolving initial concerns. When we arrived everyone was lovely so this I'm sure could be easily resolved? Would have scored higher if initial contact was better, shame!   But all in all give these guys a chance, great location for the money and the horror stories don't seem true.…",Date of stay: October 2018,3.0

Making a long story short, we ended up with no room in London, no assistance from the management and had to sleep on an airport hotel after 3 hours of searching for a room, and came back home the next day, 4 days earlier than we were supposed to. At arrival, no room was available due to water leaking/infiltrations issues - which, from other opinions on the internet that we should have seen previously from reserving the place, seems to be awkwardly frequent. After visiting the alternative proposed – Mount Apartments, which was obviously much further way from London Centre, apart from the fact that we did not enjoyed the neighborhood, or the distance to the subway – we tried to call Rivington…",Date of stay: April 2012,1.0

First off, the hotel is right next to a night-club, which plays pounding music into the small hours (2 AM). There is no double-glazing or any soundproofing, so there's nothing for it but to stay awake. The staff are inept-for some reason, despite my having a reservation, it took them 20-minutes to check me in. Not what you want after a transatlantic flight. There is also no lift-you have to haul your bags up a few (not long, but inconvenient enough) staircases to make it up to reception. There is also no staff there in the evenings.
