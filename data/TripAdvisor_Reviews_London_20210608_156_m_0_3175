Stayed this time in an executive suite, as Gillrays was closed for the first part of our stay, and I felt we needed more space! The suite, apart from the absence of a kitchen (!) was effectively a one-bedroomed apartment!  I have never been so comfortable in a hotel ""room"" in my life!  Certain elements of room service did fall a little short (an omelette in a takeaway bag?) but we we gladly provided with ""proper"" cutlery, plates etc which were replaced each day. Housekeeping was first rate (as always) and all the staff were superb.  I cannot understand the ridiculous comments in a recently-posted review about limited food - we enjoyed various dishes, and drinks were gladly sent up from Gillrays Bar! Once Gillrays re-opened, I had the most superb spatchcock chicken (No chicken dish on the menu?)  I have the geatest respect for the Hotel and the staff, and I intend to return as often as I can - which should prove easier as restrictions are relaxed.

But it’s not. I think this really is a 4 star place that charges 5 star prices. I won’t criticise the staff as it is often not their fault but it seems that Marriott bosses forgot they had hotels in the uk and left them to their own devices. The restaurant menu is terrible. All you can eat here is chips, chips or chips. There was no veg or potatoes and no flexibility if you asked for anything different to the menu. Kids menu nonexistent apart from pizza or more chips. Simple chicken dish would have done it. Breakfast was another experience altogether - cornflakes was extra charge! Really??  Someone must sort this out. Staff was good- shout out to Sandra and the valet man who parked our car. Thank you!  Location good although noisy at weekends.…",Date of stay: May 2021,3.0

We knew most services were withdrawn during the Pandemic and the published tariff was appropriately reduced.  So we got less and paid less. We asked for a room facing the Thames, and got room 224.   This was a double room with bathroom/shower.  The room was spacious and comfortable but it was located a LONG walk from the lift.   A fault was in the bathroom as the hand basin had a  plug which could not be opened - so we could not empty the basin. The shower had a hand bar which was good, but there was no hand bar to hold onto when leaving the shower - so I was not able to use the shower. Both faults could be easily remedied when Marriott have their maintenance team on site. Entrance to the hotel was via several steps; the entrance via wheelchair lift was not available. Because of very low occupancy, the restaurant was closed and dinner and breakfast had to be ordered and was delivered in brown carrier bags to the room. When I am fitter again, I would stay again at ther hotel but be forewarned of the disadvantages at the moment.…",Date of stay: March 2021,4.0

London is a great city to explore by foot or via public transportation (easy to follow and figure out - you can a day pass and use it at tubes and buses). It is about 2 miles from Oxford and Bond street where all the shopping stores are located. And about 2-3 miles from London or Tower Bridge. Uber is reasonably priced should you decide to use it.

At the price they charge does the cost of a few more teas bags really eat into their profit margin? Rooms quiet  Nice large swimming pool on the top floor  Worth a trip to the cocktail bar.

When we tried to get a bar-snack (from their advertised menu) somewhere around 11pm, we were told the kitchen was closed. The drinks pricing was also pretty steep, and the bill came with a 20% service charge. Regrettably I cannot say the service merited this fee, not did the quality of what was offered match the price.

So many London hotels, however fabulous they claim to be, cram as many rooms in as possible, with the result being that the room is too full and cluttered for you to be able to spend time chilling out in your own space. Not so here! Lovely big beds and bathrooms, lots of storage and lots of home comforts. The only negative is that the carpet in the hallway looks a bit worn- luckily this doesn't seem to be the case in the rest of the hotel but it did make me worry it might be a bit tired.   This hotel has a lovely gym and a pool, although the water was very cold and I was disappointed that there was no jacuzzi.

There was only one such suite in the hotel and it was the spaciousness, and the iconic view (albeit at a slight angle) its extra large windows afforded, that made this a very SPECIAL stay for me unlike the overall average impressions of others.  I wanted my 16yo son to wake up each day and know where he was .... and how could you not be with Big Ben, the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Bridge (& the Eye) outside the large Bay window.  The size of the suite and its view meant, for me, that the dull and aging furnishings and other limitations of the hotel reported by others were easy to overlook and forget.

It is an older property (the County Hall used to be the seat of London's government) but it is worthy of the Marriott moniker. The rooms are large, especially by European standards, and quite comfortable. We had a view of the London Eye, which is literally outside the hotel property. Some rooms do have tiny windows, so ask for one with a decent view.  The County Hall complex is still searching for an identity, as it not only houses the Marriott and the London Eye, but also is home to the London Aquarium, a tacky amusement arcade and a few restaurants.

The price was a little high but, being members of the Marriot rewards program, we were able to lower the bill using their ""Look No Further Best Rate Guarantee"" program which price matched and gave us an additional 25% off.

As suggested - I asked about upgrades upon our early check-in and within minutes (and a slight increase in the room rate) we had a river view balcony (small) suite with an incredible view of Parliament and the London Eye! The staff was very accommodating. The proximity to the bus and tube stops was very short walk. Only a few concerns - The pool hours for kids were slightly inconvenient. The food at the main restaurant was only ok, but expensive - even for London. The arcade attached to the hotel was another great diversion for the kids, after a full day of history seeking.

We found a fantastic deal on the Marriott website that allowed us to get 4 nights for the price of 3, so we took advantage! This place is AWESOME! We had a view of the Thames River and the London Eye right outside our room, and all of the top London sites are within easy walking distance of the hotel. This is going to sound silly, but one of the best things we found on our trip was the pancake cart directly across the Westminster Bridge (toward Big Ben).

Great location. The hotel is located right next to the London Eye along the Thames, and just across the bridge is Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament, and the nearest underground station (maybe an 8 minute walk). The rooms in this hotel are very spacious, clean and well appointed. Only complaint is that there is only one set of elevators on one side of the building - if you're room is on the opposite end, it's a good 7 minute walk from the elevator to your room.

The hotel was centrally located --London Eye (the big ferris wheel) was outside our window and Big Ben was just across the bridge. We were able to walk to almost everything thanks to all the bridges crossing the Thames river. London is very easy to get around. Its very much like New York City.

It's also situated well for a view of Big Ben, the London Eye, and Houses of Parliament. If location issues are top, this is a good choice. If however, the idea of a 7-star hotel (as it's listed within Marriott's system) is your top priority and you're looking for even a little luxury, go elsewhere.

I chose it because we were traveling with our three-year-old and nine-month-old, and it was one of the few hotels in London with a pool. Also, having stayed in several other parts of the city, having a river view appealed to me.  The view is amazing. Our room looked directly over the river to Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. A river view was a 25 GBP ($37.50) upgrade, and well worth it.  The rooms are standard ""American"" hotel rooms, which are quite large by London standards. Our room had 2 queen-sized beds (rare for the UK - they usually have doubles). We had plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 children, however, I would not recommend it for 3 or 4 adults.

Go elsewhere.,"I can't believe all the high reviews for County Hall, from which we just returned after a week (Nov03). In my opinion it is nowhere near a Category 7 (top) rating for a Marriott and don't know how they earned it. Other than the great location for first time visitors to London, Grosvenor or Park Lane would be better Marriott choices. It's a 'cold' looking hotel with stairs to climb (no handrail or handicap lift) just to get into the hotel, and then more once you're in just to get to the lobby. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off the wall in places. There's no coffee maker as advertised. It's just a combo tub/shower - not separate.
