Held some casual meetings there on the 3rd floor in the bar and restaurant area and was really disappointed by the lack of service and pace of it. I opened a tab for drinks and lunch for 7 people to use through out the day. Every time I went to the bar to order I waited at least 10 minutes before having to go to the front desk to request them to call someone. There were minimum people there on this day and it took a very long time to get served and request food at intervals. I even requested a lunch sandwich without rocket as I advised I didn't like it and low and behold I got rocket. I won't be using this hotel for business again.,Date of stay: July 2018,2.0

This stay was disappointing as one side of the hotel is facing the casino and bars below.

They failed to offer any form of compensation other than putting a note that the next time I stay I will have a room on the opposite side of the hotel.

Hotel is located in the Westfield shopping centre which has plenty of restaurants in it if you don't want to eat in the hotel which was expensive. Hotel was 20-30 minutes away from central London on the tube and the tube was 5 minutes from the hotel.   They do charge a service charge when you buy a drink in the bar which they do not tell you a out and they don't give you your receipt I only noticed when I was checking out they charged an extra 63p per pint, that was ok but it would be nice to know. You don't have to pay it if you don't want to also room service never answered the phone at 23.50.

It was apparently full (first day of athletics for the Paralympics) but no sign of queues or congestion anywhere in the hotel.  Great view over the Olympic Park and as handy as you can get to attending an event there.  Probably not the best menu you'll find but it's okay and there are plenty of other choices just yards away as the hotel is in the magnificent Westfield complex.

The staff are very friendly and helpful and we really enjoyed our breakfast which was good quality and plentiful. There is a fantastic shopping centre right next door…,Date of stay: May 2012,4.0
