I booked two rooms for two nights at a price of £142 per room. When I checked in, I made payment for both rooms plus £30 for two nights parking. I then noticed that an extra £142 had been taken from my bank account. I raised this with the receptionist and I was told that there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait until the next day to sort the problem as the hotel systems were down. I was not happy as we were booked in for a family meal the following evening and this money which had been mistakenly taken out was not budgeted for. These things happen so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and returned to my room for the evening.  The following morning I  went to the reception and I was told again that there was nothing that could be done and I would have to wait until I checked out to receive any money back. I then checked my bank account and noticed that I had also been charged another £30 for parking! Now I had been over charged by £172 and this caused me to have to cancel our family meal in central London and opt for a much cheaper meal nearby. This ruined our trip away, It has now been 5 days since we stayed and I have still not received any money back or so much as an apology from the Hotel! I would not expect such bad customer service from a 2 star hotel never mind a 4 star!!…",Date of stay: May 2021,2.0
1,/Hotel_Review-g186338-d21182648-Reviews-or0-Hampton_By_Hilton_London_Park_Royal-London_England.html#REVIEWS,Hampton By Hilton London Park Royal Hotel Reviews,Nice new hotel,"I have been staying here for a few weeks as I work nearby. The hotel is new and is one of the new generation hamptons with Smeg fridge in the room. As a diamond member I always receive my welcome gift and welcome drinks. If you stay here and Rachid is on shift, you can be sure that you will be greeted with a smile, and he will remember you from the second time you see him! At the start of March 2021 the hotel was offering food and drinks (including alcohol) that you need to take to your room. Breakfast is also takeaway, one thing that I enjoy is that for breakfast the pastries are always fresh, even if there are not many guests at the hotel. This is rare in these service reduced covid days and highly appreciated! You can also have a cooked breakfast that they will pack in a box with some disposable cutlery. If you want more that the food that is offered on the dinner menu, the F&B staff are happy to provide a plate and some cutlery for you to use. Ruben at the bar today was happy to help. The rooms are not 100% soundproof and I have occasionally heard people in the next room. I have been staying in rooms facing the back of the hotel, and they are nice and quiet from the outside world. This might be different for rooms on the other side of the building facing the main road. Location wise I was driving to the hotel and is it very close to the north circular road, it also has an underground station minutes away. The hotel has an underground car park that has plenty of electric charging points.…",Date of stay: March 2021,5.0

The hotel also had parking located underground for £15 per 24hour duration. The hotel was Fronted with modern decor within the lobby and room, although I had expected the room to be slightly bigger as I had booked a king supreme (thinking it would be), nonetheless the room had all the amenities needed, an iron, ironing board and hairdryer, with lots of plug outlets and USB sockets everywhere.

The small glass of zinfandel wine I had cost £7 which is rather on the higher side. It is a fully covid 19 compliant place. Service was rather slow as it appeared to me that the staff were trying to familiarise themselves with procedures or equipment snd you would see 4 staff all looking at a computer as someone is explaining something. They have a better way of doing that.,Date of stay: October 2020,4.0
