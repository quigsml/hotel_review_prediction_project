A lot of £20-£35 prices. * Sound quality in room - Didn't hear a PEEP from any other room. Rare in hotels. Clearly good. * Breakfast was VERY GOOD - options - good portion sizes. * Ensuite included. * Staff VERY VERY VERY friendly! Happy when I phoned direct to not even accept payment over the phone, and take upon arrival.   Infact, for £65 - two people, free parking, breakfast included, very friendly and kind staff he AUDACITY of some people to write 1/5  is absolutely DISGUSTING.   That's not to say it's perfect by any stretch of imagination. The bathroom was very small ( they'll know this ) the mattress had certainly had better days, the shower could be better.  However, when writing a review - can people THINK a little more before giving 1/5.   I've stayed in some horrific places, awful staff, 1/5 etc etc and this place really is not this.
