Room was too small for us, for a family of 4, 2 Adults and 2 Children, aged 11 and 4. Bed was really uncomfortable to sleep on, My 4 year old Daughter fell of the bed. Carpets were worn, stained and had been put together with Sellotape. Parking was £15 for 24 hours. Breakfast, where do I start, all we got was Hash Browns, Beans, Toast, and Croissants, was expecting at least fried eggs or Scrambled Eggs, and Mushrooms, for meat eaters, there was Bacon and Sausages, the coffee, was the worst I have come across in my life, the only benefit of this hotel is, Canning town Tube station is 5 mins walk and you can be in Central London in 30 mines…",Date of stay: April 2021,2.0

Everything was lovely, just two small issues we experienced were the room cleaning was not done daily, and the breakfast choices were very poor. Completely understand there was a lockdown but having just pork/bacon sandwiches is not sufficient. Upon requesting they offered us veg sausage sandwich (frozen sausages). Breakfast being the most imp meal for us, we expected atleast the most basic eggs to be available. It was disappointing that they didnt offer that. However that issue aside the staff is extremely friendly and always helpful. Greeted daily with smiles and always ready to help us when we needed. ",Date of stay: November 2020,3.0

Upon request, they gave us a bucket of ice & champagne glasses for the fizz we’d brought with us and also gave us peppermint tea bags as there’s only regular Tetley in the rooms. The only slight negative is that breakfast is until 10am and that means everything is cleared away at 10am (unlike other hotels I’ve stayed in).

The hotel is clean and has the normal Holiday Inn Express decor. Special surprise is the free WiFi that extended to my room as well as the reception areas.  Bed was comfortable - But the Sofa Bed was not and is far too hard.  The breakfast was a free choice of cereals, breads and sausage, scrambled egg and baked beans. Pity that the sausages were poor and the scrambled egg appeared to be made from power. Free newsapapers - The Times, i and Daily Mail gave plenty to read.

The staff were rude - they were short and extremely inhospitable during our stay. There is NO FREE WIFI like the website suggests, however you are free to use one of the two ancient computers in the lobby, but they timeout quickly. The hotel also messed up our booking - however they graciously (ha) gave three grown men sharing a room a double bed and a couch to sleep on. When we complained that they had our booking wrong, they argued that the three men in the room should have no problem sharing beds. The location was poor, it's somewhat intimidating leaving the hotel at night. My room had a nice view of a burned down building with barbed wire.

Hotel also openly allows you to order in takeaways (which were also very decently priced and tasted good too!).    My advice if travelling from the West is to use the North Circular road (A406), then onto the A13 which directs you to silvertown... beware of some internet directions which take you through the centre of London, definately not recommended!!!
