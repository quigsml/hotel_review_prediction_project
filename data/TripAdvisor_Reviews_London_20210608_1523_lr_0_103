She is able to walk short distances so we booked a private room on the 2nd floor (room 18) and the staff stored her wheelchair in the conference room for us and were kind enough to take it down and bring it up for us as we were only staying the one night. The room itself has charging usb points and plug sockets absolutely everywhere you could need them which is incredible üòç there was a kettle with tea and sugar cubes in cute little glass jars, windows for fresh air and the heating worked perfectly. The room was clean and fresh, the bathroom was clean and fresh and there were lovely white towels on the bed. This is the nicest hostel I‚Äôve ever stayed in! The only issue I had was that the mattress was very firm so perfect for back sleepers but not so great for side sleepers like myself.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2020,4.0

No one is friendly and no one greets you with a smile. They were more concerned about talking amongst themselves.   My first night was awful. The room I was in smelled disgusting. I was the only female in my room which was uncomfortable. They need to do a better job of mixing the coed rooms. The showers were tiny, gross, and clogged. I was going to leave the next day and go to a hotel. However one of the other customers suggested that I try a smaller room and use the showers upstairs.   Thanks to his suggestion my second night was much more bearable. I booked a 4 bed all girls room which was much more comfortable. I got up early after the cleaners finished and used the showers upstairs. They were definitely bigger and clean. I found the the toilets weren't as bad. Using this method I would stay again, however they really need to clean the place more than once a day.  The chill out room was ok.  ‚Ä¶",Date of stay: October 2018,4.0

Staff were rude when I asked for clean dishes. There's only one female only shower per floor until the tip floor. So you have to use communal toilets and showers.

Stayed in a 9 bed dorm room which had nice small curtains to close off each individual beds, even though there's a bar downstairs, didn't really keep me awake at night.
