The hotel was nice, staff were friendly and it was clean.  Good breakfast.  Accessibility Not very good; coming into the hotel in the evening you have to manoeuvre up a slope to present keycard or ring a bell, then reverse down a slope to open a door which opens towards you. Our room was on the ground floor so no problem with lifts etc.  The bedroom was ok with adequate room to get round.  The bathroom was hopeless - an extra toilet with rails had been added in an extra room off the ensuite, but this did not have enough space to get around in a wheelchair. The toilet roll would not fit the dispenser in there so was just on the floor.  No soap in the sink in there.  In the 'main' bathroom the towel rail was hanging off the wall.  The shower only had one rail which was too far from the seat to be of any assistance, and made the shower unusable for me.  The seat would not stay up so the shower was probably also annoying for a standing person.  Plenty of soap etc in the sink in the 'main' bathroom.

The reception staff were excellent, but it was a bit disappointing to be told there would be no room cleaning whilst we had our 3 night stay. I appreciate that they are changing things due to covid, but given that you were in our room most nights no later than 10 due to the restrictions, sitting in a room with over flowing bins wasn’t worth the money spent. Especially when a previous Hilton stay in York also in tier 2 had room cleaning going on.

Found the hotel to have some good things going, but not up to expectations overall, especially as a gold HHonors member. The DoubleTree is in a good location in the West End.  It has a nice open common area on the ground floor and then extends up and down and inwards for the guest rooms.  Once out of the common area, the hallways feel tired and parts of the hotel need renovations. As HHonors Gold, my preferences are clear regarding room locations - high floor and quiet - and most hotels will assign rooms prior to arrival to take preferences into account.

This hotel is located in an absolutely great spot in Holborn. Rooms are nice and clean, very small. The bathrooms have stalls with great controls making it a great experience. The breakfast offered is good and they offer an English breakfast - eggs, bacon, beans. The front staff again like the DT - Victoria  is a mixed bag as regards Service. Some are ok and others bad. They refused late checkouts as they were fully booked. Hilton Diamond regardless, check out is 12:00 PM. These 2 strikes made it a 3 vs 4 Stars. Both DT’s did not have luggage stands.

Usual wear and tear of a hotel but very pleasant.  the room seem very quiet as it was on the back of the hotel and it didn’t have a view but we weren’t bothered by this as I prefer quiet.  We ate in the restaurant for dinner which was lovely and had a cocktail with it. It was a very relaxed atmosphere.  On going to bed the beds were a little uncomfortable and we didn’t sleep very well. I think this due to the sprung mattresses which generally can be a little uncomfortable when getting a little old.  Overall a very pleasant stay and would recommend.,Date of stay: November 2017,4.0

Check-in was incredibly quick. The warm welcome cookie and free Starbucks coffee for every guest was a lovely touch.   The room itself was small (what do you expect for Central London) but very well laid out so it did not feel small at all. Bed was comfortable and good selection of pillows.   The thing about this hotel though is the location. Close to Euston Station. We walked everywhere. We did not need to take the tube once. It is also reasonably priced compared to other 4 star hotels in the area.  I would definitely stay here again if I ever came down to London again.,Date of stay: October 2015,5.0

Because I booked through Great Western (thought I was getting a discounted rate but the price they quoted did not include VAT!) the Hotel wanted a voucher. I produced the email receipt of the booking and it took ages for them to check us in especially because the room was paid in full in advance. Once we got through the check in we found our room on the 4th floor to be very small. It was meant to be a double room but there was only one bedside cabinet. The other side of the bed was against the wall and did not have any cabinet, shelf or even a light. The room was clean and the bed comfortable and if I paid half the price it would not have been so bad but at £138 for one night I would not recommend.",Date of stay: November 2015,3.0

After a 30 hour journey a shower and a nap was most appreciated.    Breakfast was great.  Good selection and if you are a Hilton HHonors member it's a great price too.   Beds were comfortable.

For a quality hotel you should not have to pay and whilst the wireless is free in reception that is not a conducive environment for quiet working.

However, comfortable and clean though the accommodation was, the overall effect was claustrophobic. For a supposedly double room, this was pokey; one could barely move around the bed and the walls were panelled with a rather oppressive dark wood veneer, creating a rather gloomy effect - I don't think I'd have wanted to go much beyond my one night stay. The buffet breakfast had the standard range of options available - but even for central London £18 is an inexcusable price.

The pictures on the website looked good and the prices are high (I got a good deal on the web but their advertised rates are top end in my experience), so I thought this would be a cut above your standard business hotel.  The reception area is nice enough. Decent hotel standard, but that's where it ends really. You get off the lift for your floor and all the nice touches have gone. Incredibly bare, drab, depressing corridors, quite a few missing ceiling tiles.  The room was incredibly small but not terrible. Just...fine. If all you're doing is sleeping in it, then it does the job but there's nothing to make you think 'yes, I'm glad I chose this hotel. It's a great place to stay'. A minor point, but the telly was incredibly annoying.…",Date of stay: September 2011,2.0
