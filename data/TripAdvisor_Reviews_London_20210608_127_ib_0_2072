I had two stays of 4 nights booked. The location is very good, only a couple of minutes walk to the south bank of the Thames and very accessible to other areas such as the City. I checked in online in advance so the process of collecting my room key was very quick and I was given a quiet room as requested. The room was good, usual Ibis standard. I had breakfast every day which had a good variety, was tasty and hot and was good value for money. I had an evening meal on three nights and again found the food good in both terms of taste and value for money. One thing that would have been better is maybe one or two options on the menu with vegetables as most seemed to be with chips (although the chips were really good). I found in the restaurant and bar and indeed all of the areas of the hotel the staff were very friendly. The hotel seemed much quieter than normal as the Covronavirus was just starting to have an impact, but despite this the staff were still always upbeat. When I checked out I requested the same room again for the following week as I liked the quietness. When I checked back in they managed to give me the same room and an early check in (at 0930). All in all I really enjoyed my stay and I would highly recommend this hotel and I hope it thrives again once the Coronavrius has passed.…",Date of stay: March 2020,4.0

The check in was without problems , the staff very friendly - I just want to add a comment that this new style of having an open reception area is not always convenient in my opinion. Some other guests have a lack of understanding that when you type in your credit card details in the payment system it is not the nicest thing that they don't care about distance and stand next to you. This open thing offers this - but privacy should be respected there. Rooms were clean, bit small - but it worked. Breakfast was rich and it was constantly added and refilled.

Staff are very welcoming, pleasant and helpful.  The bar and reception area are a good place to sit and work while having a drink and also to people watch.  I ate from the restaurant and the food was very good and for London very reasonably priced.    What let it down a little for me was the room.  Completely soulless, no decor on the walls, noting at all to give the room any warmth.  The layout of my room was a bit strange with the bathroom being at the window side of the room and the bed by the door. I had been put in an accessible room so maybe that's the reason.  There was no mobile phone signal in the room unless you sat by the window.  Maybe a ploy to get people to spend more time in the bar??",Date of stay: January 2019,4.0

We found ourselves in a panic when Ryanair cancelled a whole host of flights, including ours for the next day. Given that we are from the US, we didn't have service on our phones to work anything out. One of the staff members (Carla!) conjured a laptop seemingly out of thin air and allowed us to rebook and even printed our new boarding passes for us. It seems like something small but we were in full blown anxiety mode and having her assistance calmed us immensely! Makes little things like creaky doors and flickering lights seem inconsequential.

The noise on the 4th floor wasn't too bad however our room was facing a brick wall and didn't get much outside light. There were only 2 towels and 3 pillows given in the room however we just  asked for more and it wasn't a problem. Downsides were lack of outlets in the room (there were only 2) and none by the night stands. Also the AC was a little too powerful. It was a tricky finding a happy medium with the temperature.

One minor complaint I have is that you are allowed to order food to eat in your room, but you have to go to the ground floor restaurant to collect it - which is awkward getting in and out of lifts and rooms with a tray in ones hands.

It is an Accor hotel so attempts to rip off the customer come as standard.  Located just to the south of Blackfriars Bridge, Ibis London Blackfriars is in a competitive location.  Southwark underground station is less than a couple of minutes walk away.  Blackfriars station is a five minute walk over the bridge.  The area itself is not amazing with the main attraction being accounting firms but it is within easy access of key London landmarks including London Waterloo which is just around the corner.  As Ibis London Blackfriars is brand new, there are currently a range of pluses and minuses.  The pluses are that few if any customers have used the individual rooms yet.  This means that there are no…",Date of stay: October 2012,2.0

The rooms are rather  ""pod"" like and the bathroom even more so - however shower is fine. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room - although not large- was perfectly Ok. The sound proofing is first rate - we could not hear anbody walking by our room , door slamming, TV or any outside noise. I only realised just how good this was when I opened the window one morning.  We didnt have any meals there - perferred to get breakfast where ever we were visiting that day.The staff were very friendly and helpful. A request for another pillow was answered in under 5 minutes.  The venu is perfect for the globe, tate modern and its only a few yards from Southwark tube station.

As you walk in the public rooms are lovely and give that wow! factor. Have to confess I was a little disappointed with the standard Ibis style rooms I found - functional and plain.  The new beds however , as advertised, are VERY comfy!  Dinner in the  restaurant (Foggys) was reasonable price, efficient waiting staff and good quality food. Breakfast was good but a little chaotic as there aren't enough tables at peak times.  Location is good for Southbank and Southwark tube is a few minutes walk away.  All in all a good reasonably priced choice for central London, even with a few teething problems.",Date of stay: October 2012,4.0

I have never stayed in an Ibis before and chose this one for it's location and competitive price.  I was the first person to stay in my room, which was a pleasant thought. Yes, this is classed as a ""basic"" hotel I guess but certainly has everything you need. I was impressed with the design of the room and in particular the shower room; although compact the clever shower design gives a remarkable and comfortable space.  The open plan 21st century bar and restaurant is a very pleasant place. Although I didn't have dinner I did eat breakfast and the buffet was good quality and means that you save time by helping yourself.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful.
