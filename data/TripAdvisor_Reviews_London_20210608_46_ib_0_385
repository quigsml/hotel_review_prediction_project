I associate the Ibis brand with budget accommodation, good value and reasonably up to date facilities. The hotel met these expectations. The room was clean and tidy but very compact so not a lot of room for two people, and the downside for us was the aircon not working, which was not so good when we arrived close to the peak of a London heat wave, but windows did open to let some air in, though this also let in noise. Like others how have posted, I got the impression that the hotel was understaffed and while they were attentive to problems like the aircon not working, it was like 'too bad, nothing we can do about this for you'. Being a bit out of the main CBD is not too much of a problem, just allow about 30 mins to get into the…",Date of stay: July 2019,4.0

The hotel opened in November 2017 and its good to see this section of Canning Town reinvent itself with the hotel and adjacent offices. The public areas of the hotel are pleasingly laid out on the ground floor and for me was the perfect base.

Modern rooms and novel power extension and charger were welcome, as was the roomy shower rooms (something Ibis has slipped on in the past).  It has a number of glitches though. The lack of a delineated reception area coupled with insufficient staff numbers and unclear directions on how to check in, ask for help or check out was incredibly frustrating. Terrible pizza and technical issues with door locks also didn't help.

Tv, sockets, full length mirror and hair dryer present. There is aircon over the room door. It only goes down to 18C and blows about half a meter from the door. It’s pretty pointless to be honest.  With the window shut you don’t hear anything outside. As it’s so hot, you need to open it. All you can hear are cars and the DLR all night. This Ibis is directly opposite Canning Town DLR station.  If the air con was decent and cooled the room down I would rate this as 5/5 for value for money and it’s okay for 1-2 night stay. ",Date of stay: April 2018,4.0

We had no choice but to bring our dog along. It was much cheaper and more comfortable for him in a hotel at £10/ night extra.  -breakfast was around £10 each which is similar to many chain hotels with an all you can eat cooked English breakfast with continental, free refill on all drinks inclusive of hot drinks & surprisingly, a nice hot chocolate which I can't normally find in many of the budget hotels.  -with dog, breakfast X2 and one night the total was £130. An excellent price for an excellent hotel, with friendly staff.  -the manager made an effort to talk with…",Date of stay: December 2017,5.0

The bed was comfortable and the bathroom good, especially the large shower.    Breakfast was fantastic, delicious and fresh.    Staff were really helpful.  Had pizza one evening at 11.00 pm, a bit of a wait for it, but staff were excellent.   Great location, just coming out of the Tube station across the road.  Would use this hotel again.",Date of stay: November 2017,5.0

This was for a business function at the Olympic stadium at Stratford, that's two stops away, so for anything in this part of London it couldn't be easaier. Surprisingly good value for London, I got a room here on a Friday night for £65, which is pretty good in my book.  Freindliest staff you could hope for, all really helpful so 10/10 for them - the room wasn't actually ready when I got there and they sorted it all out straight away, and kept a room key aside for my wife who was arriving later.  Room is comfortable, standard Ibis design, and brand new of course as this one clearly hasn't been open long. It is well insulated too, which is just as well given the traffic outside as well. You can…",Date of stay: December 2017,4.0

Paid around 75 pounds for the one night (which isn't too bad for London being such an expensive place) and what was brilliant was that my special request to be placed in a quieter room was honored and was even given the choice as to which room I could stay in. I opted for the the room on the top floor, in which as true to their word, I heard no traffic or construction work from the outside world. The only things I heard were people moving around the corridor- which, not an awful lot can be done about due to newer hotels and building having thin paper walls for sound to travel through.   Ate at the bar/restaurant later in the evening and ordered a no thrills Margarita…",Date of stay: November 2017,5.0

It is a very new hotel and has a lovely funky design. Check in was efficient and friendly.  The room was typical Ibis design but was very small compared to other London Ibis and my room had lots of wasted space.  Food in the bar was good and I had the delicious chicken dinner.  Staff need a bit of retraining. One of the staff could not seem to pre-authorise my credit card so as to charge to room and as I was walking out next morning a woman on ""reception"" asked if I wanted to check out. No I didn't since you're supposed to just walk out!!!!  Despite this it's highly recommended and I will stay here again.",Date of stay: November 2017,4.0

Although it is a bit far away from Central London, it can be easily accessed with the Jubilee Line or DLR (the station is just on the other side of the road). It was by far the best value for money hotel that I have found in London for the dates I needed to stay. The room was soundproof, the staff were nice and breakfast was good. The only missing component were fried eggs, with only scrambled eggs available.",Date of stay: November 2017,5.0
