The Liverpool Doubletree definitely did not reach the excellent standard displayed by this hotel. Same stars, same overnight price, but Doubletree Greenwich exceeded my expectations. Good central location, near numerous bus routes on the A2 and near Deptford Bridge and Greenwich Stations.   This hotel carries a elegant, spiritual theme, converted from an old police station. Awesome, clean decor, but limited chargeable expensive parking. Make sure you pre-book parking here if you need it as spaces go quick. There is very restricted on street parking for 4 hours only. This hotel can get busy, being so close to many Greenwich sights, but does not feel busy with good use of space and ultra attentive staff.  Friendly, helpful and quick check in with the obligatory warm Doubletree cookie. Room well laid out, clean and functional. Partial view from the third floor. Unlike the Liverpool equivalent, some free water and a king size bed here. Bathroom immaculate, walk in shower pleasant. Room service, quick and not too expensive.   Breakfast was a la carte for COVID times, freshly cooked when ordered and you can order as much as you need. Andreea, the breakfast room host runs a tight ship and ensures everyone is COVID secure and has everything they need. Plenty of room and hot food, even towards the end of breakfast service.   Check out was very friendly, quick and invoice provided by E-Mail.   Excellent service and good value for money.…",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

Due to a personal issue I had to at the last minute cancel our stay but circumstances then immediately changed and I had to then try and reinstate our booking within 10 minutes of cancelling.  Raquel (I apologise if this is the incorrect spelling) on the telephone couldn’t have been more understanding and helpful and we were so appreciative that, thanks to her help, we were after all able to enjoy our weekend away.  Our room, 906, was a king deluxe on the 9th floor, a bit of a faff with the two lifts but nothing to moan about, a great view and plenty of room.  Obviously with Covid restrictions things such as housekeeping service were pretty tricky and it was a shame that as we were so late arriving that we didn’t realise until the following morning that housekeeping had to be pre-booked but we know for next time!  Breakfast was excellent with wonderful, helpful and friendly staff.  The car park was a bonus and all reception staff couldn’t have done more to ensure we had a good stay.  A short, easy walk to all of the Greenwich attractions and, should we wish to stay in that area of London again we will certainly make this our choice of hotel.…",Date of stay: May 2021,5.0

However I did book this because of their website that shows a lovely freestanding bath in the room, but when I checked in, there was no bath, just a shower. I had too much work to do to bother reception so I left it - however when I left I felt that was possibly false advertising so I wrote to Hilton’s main customer experience centre to raise it with them - I paid for something that wasn’t there really.

Breakfast was tasty with lots of choice also.

It was the best trip of my life (and I have traveled A Lot.) The hotel was adorable and in the perfect location, nestled up against older houses and a quant neighborhood you feel like you are just part of the Greenwhich community. Perfect walking distance to everything in the town and just a few minutes walk to the Tube. My favorite part of the stay was truly the staff especially Lucia, she was so kind and accommodating. When we asked for a larger room she upgraded us with no questions. She truly wanted to give us the best experience possible. We could Not have asked for a better stay or better accommodations.

Also you can travel each day any where in zone 1 & 2 ( all attractions are here) as many trips as you like for a max of 6.5 GBP.

It's a really nice hotel with a DLR station just a few minutes walk away, although the hotel itself is set on a quiet square just off the main A2 road. The rooms are on the small side but perfectly comfortable, nicely decorated and equipped in a very modern style, and spotlessly clean. The bad was comfortable. There is free wifi. Staff are friendly and helpful and it seems there a some great value rates to be had here.  The only reason we've rated 4/5 instead of 5 is that our room was at the back of the hotel on the 5th floor. At ground level there is a row of 16 high-powered chiller fans (heat pumps probably) that run continuously. At night, they are pretty noisy.",Date of stay: August 2014,4.0

I booked 22 double rooms, the O4 room for the venue and the staff did the rest.  It was a fantastic experience and so effortlessly organised by the staff, catering for 46 guests they set up a private room with our own bar and a handful of helpful and happy staff.  Most of the organising was done over phone and emails, two senior staff members Michelle & Rachael were so friendly, helpful and really well organised. Not 1 bad word could be said for the amount of effort that went into the whole day/night. The food was one of the best Christmas dinners I've had, (except at home)!

It's cheap for London - we paid £70 a night for 4 nights. We booked ahead to get this rate.  2. It's next to a DLR station and is in Zone 2 (handy for Travelcards). Bank station in the City (where a bazillion tube lines intersect) is 20 minutes away. The Jubilee Line at Canary Wharf takes you to London Bridge (for the Shard) & the O2 (1 stop away).  3. The DLR is pretty groovy - like a monorail. Plus it travels through Canary Wharf ...  4. .... which is about 7 minutes away on the DLR and is worth a half day by itself.   5.

We were offered a choice of rooms on the ground floor - our choice as my husband has limited mobility,  Only negative was poor access for wheelchair users - management please take note.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.  The bar was very nice; excellent service - sorry cannot remember the bar man's name but he was so attentive.  Prices not too bad - thought the wine prices a little excessive - but we chose to drink other things.  Nothing was too much trouble.  We would go again.",Date of stay: December 2012,5.0

You can get a room for 100 or less and obviously more. Location is great for east London, few mins away from DLR station. Amazing latte!  Recommend it highly.",Date of stay: November 2012,5.0

We needed to be comfy, clean and feel a little bit spoilt without over-indulgence and that's exactly what we got!!! With a minor hiccup regarding the post code vs the Sat. Nav., we actually found the Hotel, a beautifully refurbished ex-police division house, by using that antequated 'follow-your-nose' approach (it turns out that the building had been unused for a decade or so and had fallen by the wayside when new post codes were allocated to the area; so bear this in mind and type 'Catharine Grove' into your Sat Nav...) The hotel boasts limited parking and, although we were unlucky as we arrived quite late on a Saturday, we found street parking foc within easy reach. We were greeted by friendly, helpful staff and were assisted…",Date of stay: November 2012,5.0

It is easily a cut or two above anything else in the area. Food in the restaurant is superb, and adore the glamorous bar area. The hotel is set in an Art Deco building and the hotel cleverly reflects that style throughout. You half expect to bump into Hercule Poirot! There are also stunning views across London. What truly sets it apart though is the staff - young, enthusiastic and welcoming. It's refreshingly informal with more than a touch of glamour. An unbeatable combination.

I loved the modern, yet classic charm of the public rooms and my bedroom was so comfortable that I immediately found the whole experience totally uplifting.  The hotel has a young well trained staff who are so willing to please.  I treated myself to one of their recommended cocktails before taking dinner which I thoroughly enjoyed too.  In the morning I was in a hurry but managed to take breakfast - again first rate, buffet style with hot dishes, so I was not kept waiting and made it in good time for my early appointment.  The Mercure Hotel Greenwich is ideal for both business and  leisure.  It is conveniently situated with it's own large car park, a rarity these days especially in city centre hotels.",Date of stay: November 2012,5.0

It is located in Greenwich a little bit far from central london but the accesabitily is good by train and bus. It is 1 hour and 20 minutes away from the Heathrow airport. Taxi will charge around 100 pounds. The hotel is a little bit expensive, as most of the things in london, and small bedrooms. But Greenwich is a good place to stay.",Date of stay: November 2012,4.0
