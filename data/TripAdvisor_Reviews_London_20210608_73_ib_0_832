From the very beginning of our stay, we were warmly greeted by the general manager Brian, who provided us with impeccable hospitality. During our month-long stay whilst moving, he not only made every effort to ensure that our time at ibis was as comfortable as possible, but also made it feel like home for us. We were particularly impressed by the way Brian handled our requests, making the most of the resources available at the hotel whilst in the midst of a national lockdown, offering us what felt like five-star service. His conscientious approach meant that he always went the extra mile, even providing us with extra space for additional luggage and carefully ensuring that information was passed onto his team when he was on leave. Brian was friendly, attentive and extremely helpful, making sure everything was quickly taken care of and arranged for our convenience. His professionalism was second to none.   The hotel also has an excellent location with only a short walk to Canary Wharf. The area felt very safe, there was onsite parking which was essential for us, as well as excellent transport links and a range of amenities nearby. The rooms were well priced and had everything we needed.   Overall, we enjoyed a very pleasant experience with exceptional service, and we would most certainly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to stay in the area!

Were given keys to room 114. The room stank of fresh sewage. We were then offered rooms 112 and 116 which also smelt terrible ( so bad I was actually gagging). We were told by the receptionist that this always happens when it’s raining and that there were no other rooms available. If we hung around until 11pm (ish - no definite time!) we could speak to the manager. So here we are on a Saturday night with nowhere to stay. How on earth this hotel can sell rooms which are a health hazard is beyond me. Cheers Ibis and Accor for ruining our weekend!

Given the proximity of local transport (ie, it's right next to Blackwall bus station and the Docklands light rail stop) the distance out was not a problem (you need to get an Oyster card or it can be expensive).

The hotel is modern, clean, well lit, friendly staff, comfortable bed, excellent shower, adequate restaurant and quiet at night.  All we needed really.

We had previously stayed at the Brittania, a drab and depressing hotel which was twice the price. The Ibis cost us £58 for a clean, basic room with free parking. the bathroom was a pod but well planned and again very clean.  I like staying just outside the city centre. The DLR is a few minutes away and travel into the centre is easy. The 'restaurant' is the foyer, but there are lots of good places to eat on the Wharf. We particularly like Carrlucio's, the Italian restaurant. There is a tunnel under the Thames, about a mile along the river path, which brings you up in Grenwich, a good place to walk for a late breakfast.

We both liked our food, but found eating in at the hotel to be very poor.  There are some very good restaurants in Canary Wharf.  Also we chose to have breakfast at McDonalds about 5min walk away. We wouldn't normally eat at McDonalds, but was a better choice than the one on offer at the hotel and cheaper too.
