The problem IHG have is that there is little or no consistency at all and standards vary widely.

In a MARRIOTT they are pretty much all the same- you know what you are going to get- with IHG it really can be a lottery- no more so than with the Holiday Inn brand.

Sam made us feel like honoured guests and old friends, a real skill in someone dealing with so many visitors. We had booked an executive room that was clean and comfortable with the extra touches you would expect. The hotel is convenient for North Action tube but worth remembering there is another Holiday Inn adjacent to the station which didn't look so nice.

It is close to North Acton tube station for easy access into London city centre and only 15 mins from Wembley stadium. White City shopping centre is only 10 mins away.  The staff at the hotel are excellent always friendly and more than willing to make your stay an enjoyable and relaxing one nothing is to much trouble to them It's also family friendly. The rooms are clean and tidy and they are serviced every day.  The hotel rooms are reasonably priced and affordable for a standard Room meanwhile you will pay a little extra to be upgraded to an Executive room.

It was also my first time at this hotel. While the pictures on the website seemed decent enough, there is a whole lot that you will not get to know of until you actually stay here.  For starters, the room size was miniscule and dated. The beds had a creaking sound whenever you sit, lie down, turn, or get up from the bed. Absolutely shocking. And the bathroom reminds me of the younger days I used to stay at hostels whilst playing sport.  If you asked me, I think the hotel is really understaffed.

The rest of the plate contained a desert spoon of dry greyish mash, half a tablespoon of wrinkly frozen peas and a handfull of leaves (with pie and mash?) presumably to fill the plate, together with a container of gravy. I have to say for ¬£14.95 I was very underwelmed and when prompted, politely told the floor manager who assured me my thoughts had been passed to the chief.

The location is fantastic for visiting Central London, with North Acton tube station being literally less than a 3 minute walk away down one road (very easy to find). We had food here on our first night. Although it was delicious the smaller bites are indeed very small, too small to be a meal so be warned! We did have a pudding to make up for it though!
