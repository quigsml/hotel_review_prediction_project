We were travelling for property viewings which per government guidance was a reasonable excuse to travel even before the lifted restrictions. On the day we were arriving  (after 11am) I had a call from the hotel to ask me for the reason of our trip. I’ve explained and was told that this is ok . Half an hour later they called again to explain that the “general manager” doesn’t think that this is essential travel ... they’ve cancelled our stay with no notice , 2 hours before our arrival. They had 1 full week to check why we are travelling and during this time sent me numerous emails to offer room upgrades but only managed to call me on the day ... absolutely awful experience and unnecessary stress for me and my family. I have managed to book another hotel but obviously had to pay extra for the last minute booking .…",Date of stay: April 2021,1.0

My best friend and I were staying here in order to be fitted for my wedding dress.  Given that government advice was not to travel, given the rapidly increasing and high rates of infection in London, the impending lockdown (which came the day after) and the fact that BOTH myself and my best friend are frontline NHS workers (nurse and therapist on frontline wards), we decided that we did could not go against advice potentially increase the risk to either ourselves or those we work with.   I contacted the hotel to ask if anything could be done, any alternative at all. They refused.  I tried again after lockdown. They refused. Secret escapes have subsequently contacted them. They refused.   One semi silver lining is that my wedding is having to be postponed anyway, so I can rearrange to have my dress fitting whilst staying at another hotel.  Whilst so many other businesses I have been in contact with, and am aware of, have been kind and flexible where they can, it demonstrates the true moral compass of this company, that they will not even enter into discussion about it.  I would recommend, particularly in these uncertain times, DO NOT use this hotel. Find a hotel that values the customer, because if we lock down again, or you need any flexibility, they refuse to even discuss it.…",Date of stay: March 2020,1.0

Have stayed before so telephoned reservations to request nice room if possible, all accepted.  On arrival was met by Sara a very aggressive rude receptionist looking who argued with me for 15 minutes about the fact that they hadn’t got my request! Telling me I hadn’t rang them directly !!!  What was laughable was that the hotel was almost empty! At the end of her outburst she said on this occasion she would grant my request!!!! Please, I don’t think I have ever been treated so badly as a customer in a hotel.  Later that evening I informed Giuseppe customer services manager of my experience. He was very nice and apologetic, however my partners birthday was not as I had planned due to this nasty start and an apology at this stage seemed futile. To add insult to injury...... We were staying on a groupon deal and the menu in the food hall was limited to three options! There was no mention of this from groupon when booked.

The bed would have been a squeeze for two borrowers! So much for repaying ones loyalties. To make matters worse, I had a few drinks in the bar, late at night; was charged £6.33 for an advertised £5.75 pint three times.

To look at or take something from the back, you either must remove all garments of move them out of the way.  Not only terribly inconvenient, but it wrinkles all the clothes hanging there.

You have to pay a pretty hefty deposit as soon as you arrive, which if you did not know it's pretty shocking when you were going to use that money for London.

Shame about the parking.,"We recently stayed for one night at the weekend. Hotel is lovely, welcoming staff (you even get a warm cookie on check-in which is a nice touch), the room was spacious and clean. The only annoyance is the heater/air conditioning fan was running constantly and could not be switched off. Breakfast was buffet-style and had everything you could want or need. The biggest downside is the parking situation. The hotel clearly had exhibitors for events at the Excel staying who had monopolised the free to park spaces, This meant we had to use the pay-and-display alongside the hotel - the issue being you only get free parking from 5:30pm to 9:00am which doesn't cover the length of stay in the hotel (3:00pm to 12:00pm) so you have to buy tickets. £5 for 2 hours or £12 for 8 hours.

The rooms are quiet and so there was no trouble sleeping.   The breakfast was fairly good, although it was a bit strange that you could not make your own toast. However, happy to see that they had soya milk out.  Check in was fine, but check out was very slow, a queue of 4/5 people, with only one person serving.
