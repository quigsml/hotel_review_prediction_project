All rooms are so close together and not well ventilated. Not to mention there is no open windows at height level. I was told on numerous occasions this will be sorted for me. However, it gets worse every time I walk out of my room. The room is nothing like the pictures on booking.com - it’s tiny, can’t even fit a suitcase between the front door and the bathroom. And for a 3 star hotel, it isn’t clean at all, had to complain about dirty stains on the sheets before I even slept in the bed! There is no breakfast provided, sockets aren't near the bed, no ironing facilities or air con like the website says I’d get within my room type. On my final night staying here, I felt physically sick, I walked in the hotel to see loads of blonde haired prostutiates in the hotel lobby wearing skimpy outfits. One lady had her buttons on her shirt undone with a jacket on her shoulder speaking to the guy on reception. Quite clearly he paid her for sex on his shifted…",Date of stay: April 2021,1.0

Room size and decoration was ok for a budget hotel, the shower room was small but had everything I needed and looked fairly newly decorated. There were some signs of damp on the outside wall and around the window but again nothing too terrible. The communal areas could do with a lick of paint and some new carpet.

As I entered I knew it was budget but I at least expected it to be clean. The entrance is cheap looking with a hatched reception opposite a 2 seater settee with a mirror above. On a positive side, there was plentiful of tourist information on a rack in the lobby before the small lift. The room was also small and in desperate need of refurbishing. Crammed in the small room was a single desk with a stool and a mirror. Just above the desk is a small shelf with tea/coffee facility. Either side of the small double bed was tiny bedside door-less cupboards incorporated on the headboard. There was a single wardrobe in a corner with 1 shelf, an unstable hanging rail and a fan inside. The window had a thick layer of black mould around it, especially in the corners which caused the white net curtains to have a black bottom. The view was of the street with tall buildings. There was also an old picture, a full length mirror and a wall mounted flat screen TV. At the door to the bathroom was a wall mounted hair dryer and the door of the bathroom couldn't open fully as it touched the bed. The bathroom was tiny with a shower on the right that would not fit anybody obese, a single sink in the middle that you could just about stand in front with the door closed and the toilet to the left. Above the sink was a mosaic mirror and a single glass shelf with some toiletries. The bathroom did not need updating but needed enlarging. The breakfast was in a ground floor room behind the reception that looked like a small school's canteen but surprisingly had hot & cold food that was OK.…",Date of stay: October 2019,1.0

Firstly I will say that when we arrived we couldn't find the hotel because it is named 'metro hotel' from the outside and there is no indication that it is 9a. When we arrived we were placed on the 4th/5th floor and the stairs were incredibly steep which wasn't ideal as we had a lot of luggage. We weren't offered any help with our cases/bags either. So when we got into the room it looked absolutely nothing like how it appeared online to the point that we had to phone up and check we were staying in the correct hotel.
