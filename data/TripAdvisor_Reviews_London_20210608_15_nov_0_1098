I have stayed across all rooms categories previously.   Pros:  1. Great facilities and very clean. Gym and pool facilities are excellent although I did not visit on this occasion.  2. If you like a room with a view, definitely ask for a city view room on a high floor. Although you do pay a significant premium for this.   3. Highly recommend the executive suites if you find a deal. Executive rooms no longer have lounge access.   Cons 1. Check in is slow. I normally book same day and although I received a confirmation email, it never seems to fully transfer to the reservation system so it needs to be recreated manually. Overall check in took 10 minutes despite being first in the queue. I think this is an issue with Accor system rather than the hotel itself.   2. Loyalty does not seem to be recognised. No acknowledgement of Accor loyalty status at all which is disappointing on my first return stay after Covid absence. No complimentary water in rooms and none in fridge. I was asked whether I stayed here before despite staying approximately 12 times previously.   3. Avoid the rooftop bar Bokan at all costs. While the view is amazing, the service is appalling. I made a reservation for the bar and was seated. Despite being a relatively quiet mid week evening, my order wasn‚Äôt taken for about 20 minutes. There was no apology for the wait and while I was extremely polite to the waiter, I watched the drinks being made and they sat there for another 8-10 minutes before the waiter delivered them to the table. Empty glasses were sat on my table for another 20 minutes and not one waiter came over to ask if we wanted anything else. I also asked for a water which never arrived. While I was seated, the table need to me ordered two bottle of champagne and the waiter came up to them approximately 12 times to top their glasses up but never once came over to us despite trying to get his attention. I had planned to spend money on here but clearly they were not interested so after an hour I left disappointed. No thank you or goodbye by any of the staff I walked past. A round of drinks for 2 came in at ¬£30 including service charge which I felt annoyed at paying for the ‚Äòservice‚Äô  In the end, I went back to my room and ordered a drink on room service which was another 20 minutes. It seems the strategy here is to make ignore the majority of guests and focus on the ‚Äòbig spenders‚Äô clientele.   4. I didn‚Äôt have breakfast on this occasion so cannot comment. I usually avoid the ¬£25 breakfast as previously the hot breakfast has been cold and disappointing. If you want breakfast, I would recommend ordering it as room service to ensure it is freshly cooked to order.   Overall I was disappointed and don‚Äôt think I will return here. There are cheaper hotels with a far better service‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2021,2.0

I‚Äôve reached around 50 stays now, so I am well overdue a review!   Some of the reasons it beats other hotels in London for me: - Overall design - the rooms and public areas are modern, minimalist but also really comfy. - Top floor restaurant and bar - rivals most central London bars, with a better view and a nice chilled ambience. - Breakfast - a great selection and again, you get to enjoy it all from the top floor. - Spa/Pool - having a pool in London is a real perk. There‚Äôs a sauna and gym too. - Staff - and this is really the best part. The people who work at this hotel clearly enjoy their job and care about the customers. They‚Äôre friendly, professional, and consistently go above and beyond to make your stay special.  For all these reasons, I will keep coming back. As always, thank you to all the staff!‚Ä¶",Date of stay: December 2020,5.0

I wanted to stay in this area of London as I thought it would be quieter and had wanted to explore this area instead of central London.

The view from the room is spectacular and praise for how clean the room was.

One of the changes was they do not do room service so we had to stack used towels and floor mats somewhere for 2 nights and the bins both in the bathroom and outside were full up so it was quite a mess.  We requested to have a room service as we had dinner outside but I was told it wasn't possible due to covid restrictions which didn't quite make sense to me since they would have cleaned the room when we check out regardless. I understand that the pandemic made it extra difficult to fulfill these things but I really believe something needs to be done in this area of concern one way or another as it ends up smelling and looking unpleasant‚Ä¶",Date of stay: October 2020,3.0

The chef, or lack of needs to find a new vocation.  While the potato skins were nacho style, they were inedible. The skin was so dehydrated and crisp I couldn't even cut with a knife.  The guacamole was tasteless and so that of the salsa.  If it wasn't for the amazing espresso martinis and service I'd have asked for the manager.

The hotel rooms are modern, clean, nicely arranged and completely quiet, have amazing views. The air is very clean and fresh, which is a big plus!  Reception service was top. Restaurant-bar service not. I had to find a waiter multiple times to get anything going.  Breakfast is way overpriced (25 pounds) and only average compared to similarly priced hotels. Go to the Radisson Blu then you know what you should have on the plate for 25 pounds. The view from the restaurant/bar however is fantastic and the chocolate mousse was AMAZING.  Overall, I can recommend the hotel and will gladly stay there again. See you soon",Date of stay: July 2018,4.0

Secondly the staff are so friendly and genuinely happy to do anything for you, which is quite rare, they were all so polite and chatty. Similarly, the little touches is what makes this hotel special, the swimming pool and gym are lovely, everything from the bottles of water and chocolates in the room (it was my birthday) to the Bluetooth speaker, the little touches really make this hotel!

Not this one. I had booked this hotel which opened 2 months before my stay. Asked Accor if I could change hotels they refused. Arrived with lots of security on the door. Security inside. Not discrete. Key cards did not work on the lift. Another lady was stood at the lift in her dressing gown on the reception floor as her key card stopped working on the lift. Nightmare. Rooms were noisey and small. Lifts were faulty with key cards. Won't stay here again. ,Date of stay: April 2017,1.0

The hotel staff were lovely, very attentive & most wished us happy anniversary & made us feel special.  The breakfast was first class, with so much choice & a chef on hand to make other requests. The hotel itself is an easy 10 min walk from the station which from Waterloo was an easy journey, straight on the jubilee line. The views from our room on the 25th floor were fantastic & even better from the restaurant & terrace. We got to sit under a blanket, cocktail in hand & watch the sunset over London. Bliss.

I only had two very minor niggles which I raised on check   - one was that the bathroom mirror light was not working and  - two - the tea pot was ridiculously heavy ( even the waiter commented on it when he brought it to the table) I found it quite difficult to pour - having to use two hand. I don't think everyone would be able to cope with the weight so I suggested to have some lighter pots available if people preferred. very funky design but just not practical in my humble opinion,Date of stay: February 2017,5.0

Went for a quick visit during the most windy day of 2017, then realised we had to return with our 2 children once they had finished school.  The staff are all so friendly, presenting the kids food by lifting up steel cloches!  Nothing is too much trouble and the food is soooo good. Hot, so tasty and on time. The chocolate souffl√© pudding is AMAZING!!! Cheese served at the correct temperature, something that so many places get so wrong.  Even the detail of having animals on the kid sized cutlery.

The room had a definite wow factor, from the view out of the window to the simplicity of the stylish bathroom. Although we were quite tired, we visited the rooftop bar 'Bokan' 39 at the recommendation of Luca. The music was spot on, not overpowering but enough to provide a great atmosphere.

At one end os the bar serving great drinks - the other end and downs stairs is their restaurant and then the best bit was a large outdoor terrace , so you could smoke without having to go down all those floors!

The beef was good but the lobster was superb, one of the most tender I've ever tasted.  The restaurant and bar are on floor 37, 38 and 39, with panoramic views of both the nearby towers of Canary Wharf and the London skyline a few miles away.
