The hotel is a short walk from East India DLR, 10 minutes from Stratford, Bank and Canary Wharf.  Not really much around the hotel itself but it is a useful base. The room was only ¬£29 for the night. As with all Travelodges, clean and comfortable with your own tea making facilities.  My room did not have any air conditioning and instead was treated to a fan.... Good value, probably wouldn't stay at this one again, and maybe pay a little more for something where there is a little more going on.

Hotel is very conveniently located a short distance from the o2 on the dlr and underground.  Parking is easy and cheap at just ¬£8 a day.  That's where the positives end though unfortunately. The hotel is tired, dirty and in desperate need of refurbishment.   Checked into our room only to find the toilet leaking and wouldn't flush...they did change our room but the cleaner would have noticed this and never reported it.  The rooms are very basic...which is fair enough as it's Travelodge, but the taps and shower unit were caked in timescale and the whole room and bathroom just felt grubby.  Needless to say I doubt I would ever visit again until it was refurbished which I guess probably won't be any time soon.",Date of stay: February 2019,2.0

The SuperRoom was clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful, particularly Jordan on reception!  The only negative was the breakfast experience, which was a bit of a rugby scrum! The restaurant is far too small and understaffed in relation to the number of guests staying at the hotel, therefore there was a massive queue for a full restaurant with a one in and one out situation to sit at dirty tables!

Great hotel.,"We had a nightmare at Stansted and had been awake 14+ hours when we arrived at London Docklands Travelodge. Jordan on reception was fantastic, he went above and beyond to get us checked into our room as early as the team could manage. Later in our stay he printed out some boarding passes for us which doesn't seem like much but was a massive help and a weight off our mind. The room was spotless and the breakfast and evening meal we enjoyed were really satisfying. The WiFi was fairly fast and didn't drop out at any time during our stay, the rest of London is readily accessible via the Docklands Light Railway East India stop which is 5mins walk from the hotel.

The room had the usual bed, which was okay. We're talking standard double, but even though it was basic, there are levels of basic! The price was ¬£105 per night as we had booked 10 months ago! The worst thing for me was the nasty shower curtain - in this day and age, c'mon! They gravitate towards you giving you less space in the already tiny space to try & actually shower. Having to actually request a hairdryer - standard surely? No fridge - possibly a luxury? Even the coffee/tea on offer was just in a small plastic container not even a tray.

The area itself is a bit rough, so wouldn't advise going out haha! but for a nice and quiet affordable stay in london, I would stay again.",Date of stay: July 2017,4.0

For what we paid everything was nice, clean towels, tea/coffee in the room and the bed was surprisingly comfy.

Not even once. Also, I made the mistake to pay for an early check-in and I immediately found out that the room was far from ready. The bathroom was flooded and a pizza box with leftovers and a tub with dipping sauce was under the bed. In addition to that, there was no soap in the hand wash dispenser. Despite raising the issues with the staff at the reception I didn't notice any improvements at all and I considered moving to another hotel, but as it was within the Christmas period, I wasn't able to afford it.",Date of stay: December 2017,1.0

Staff are very helpful, I have witnessed on couple of occasions how they were helping other people with genuine curtesy. Bar cafe has nice food and drinks offer. Breakfast was a bonus.

There was a coffee pod machine to make espresso, a hairdryer and iron+board all in the room (most items I have previously had to ask reception for). The modern fixtures, fittings and design also transform it into a much cosier and comfortable room. Nothing more I would ask for from a room at this price.",Date of stay: December 2017,5.0

No hot water to shower one morning, noisy people in the room beside us. My husband wanted to leave after the first night.  We booked a family room, the camp beds were solid. The hotel is tired in the room we had it felt a little grubby. The breakfast was a poor choice and not nice. Unfortunately because we booked using the saver deal we cannot get any money back.  The bar area and reception were neat and tidy but not enough tables for breakfast, although the bar mens toilet was in a terrible state.  The staff were all lovely but we are going home in pain and sadly we wouldnt use this hotel again.",Date of stay: December 2017,1.0

You cant walk there even though it is near - you need to use the LDR. Welcome was nice, hotel pretty much what you‚Äôd expect. However, the room had water marks on the ceiling in both bedroom and toilet, mould on ceiling by doorway. I‚Äôm not convinced the room was properly cleaned after the last person. There were hairs on the sheets when i pulled them back, and the bin in the toilet still had a sanitary product in it. Eurgh! Will not use this hotel again.",Date of stay: December 2017,2.0
