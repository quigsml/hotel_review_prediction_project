Go elsewhere. ,"This is the 3rd time I have stayed here where the tv doesn’t work. Remote does not connect and when I finally figured out how to work it manually, there is no connection to itv2 - a free view channel which happens to be my favourite. This was the exact same problem when I stayed here last time several months ago, in a different room.

A clingy shower curtain which makes me cringe whenever it touches me, which it often does due to the small size of the shower cubicle.…",Date of stay: December 2017,1.0

I always ring in advance to give them notice of my planned arrival time, and always request a room facing inwards, towards the car park, as it is much quieter than the side facing the A13, especially on weekdays! I have always found the hotel staff helpful and accommodating. For the first time I ate early evening in the bar/café area, and the food was pretty fair for the price. Breakfast is still the continental style / cooked scenario, which provides a good start to the day, especially when walking around London. Always happy to stay here!",Date of stay: December 2017,4.0
