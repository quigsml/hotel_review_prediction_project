Itâ€™s a super short walk to the bars, restaurants and shops. The room was immaculate and spacious enough for our 1 night. They also provide free tea and coffee in the lounge which was lovely to grab in the morning.   We did forget to pack toothpaste and the hotel don't provide any. But a brand new Co-op has just opened up about 10 seconds walk from the hotel which is very helpful for hotel guests!   No window in the room which had pros and cons. Pro = incredible night sleep as no natural light entered the room in the morning. Con = did my makeup and didnâ€™t realise how strong/unblended it was until I stepped out of the hotel. (So overall not a huge problem).  Staff were so lovely and attentive. Incredibly easy check-in/out. Only 1 staff member was very slow and rather unhelpful throughout the weekend which was irritating (she looked new to the job) but this wouldnâ€™t deter us from going back.â€¦",Date of stay: June 2021,4.0

Located on a back street, itâ€™s incredibly quiet despite being in the midst of bars and restaurants. My wife is a light sleeper but didnâ€™t have any issues staying here. Whilst the rooms are definitely compact and small, theyâ€™ve been smartly designed, eg with space under the bed for luggage, hidden drawers, bedside tables built into the wall, etc. Staff in reception was always friendly and greeted us in/out of the hotel. Due to location, itâ€™s easy to pick up breakfast in the area or have a beer before calling it a night. Close proximity to 3 main stations. Will definitely stay here again!",Date of stay: April 2021,5.0
