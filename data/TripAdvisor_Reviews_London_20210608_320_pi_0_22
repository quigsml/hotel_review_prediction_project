We were greeted at the entrance by lovely member of staff who made us feel at ease and was super helpful. We stayed in family room which was so clean my little one took her shoes at the entrence. We had big bed and little sofa that was made for my 3 year old into her own bed. Bathroom was also super clean with beautiful bath (which was very helpful specially for bathing my baby). There was plenty of towels, hangers, kettle, tea, coffee, TV with freeview, internet access and hair dryer to make us feel at home.

Easy to find off the main road, the carpark is around the back opposite the hotel.  Slight issue with the buzzer to open the gates to the carpark but they eventually open.  Plenty of parking.  Always had a lovely welcome by the reception team.  Due to the pandemic the menu in the restaurant is reduced but that is fine.  The team have brought my meal to my room for me on both occasions, which is really appreciated as they don’t have to do it.  Rooms have always been spotless clean and a good nights sleep each time, very quiet hotel.   Breakfast is great, cooked to order so no buffet due to the pandemic but the staff are very attentive.  A fantastic hotel for the price and a great location.  Will definitely be back! ",Date of stay: January 2021,5.0

Me and my 2 daughters spent 4 nights at this hotel from 1st - 5th August. We did not know what to expect and we were nervous since the hotel had only just re-opened after the COVID lockdown. Everything was sparkling clean, lots of prominent hand sanitiser stations set up and screen dividers were placed between tables (which actually were an improvement as your table seemed more private). The restaurant was open for breakfast but not for evening meals at this point.  Staff were obviously well prepared for the re-open. Everything was operating very smoothly.  In fact the staff are the reason why I feel I must write the review.  Every single one of them were  brilliant and professional.
