Most definitely not.   The rooms are largely the same - although this was a smaller double bed than some which have king size - but what differentiates them then is the staff.   Do the staff care?  I would say here the answer is a resounding ""no"". There's just a feeling of ""it's my job"" - no pride, no care, no above and beyond. No interest really.   First off it took 5-10 minutes to be let in via the gate barrier. No messages at the barrier explaining someone will eventually let you in. No press button to get staff. Nothing really. As I started to phone the hotel to find out what's going on, the barrier raised. Whether you get in quickly depends where the staff are. A bad start.   Both days breakfast was poor.

Well, it's a great hotel.....if you can find it. you have to turn SHARPLY off of a corner and drive through an industrial estate, then the views from our window was of..........a giant scrap yard. The views from the other windows were of overpasses and roads. But otherwise I couldn't fault it, so if the view isn't your bag and you have a good sat nav. book it - its a great place to overnight or…",Date of stay: December 2014,5.0

Was told they only had 1 oven. Staff over friendly and feels very scripted and forced. Photographic shoot took place that got in the way booking in and getting drinks. Appreciate its a new hotel but need to sort their kitchen out. Breakfast tables left un cleared on certain days and often breakfast items running out and then asked to wait 8 mins for the sausages to cook.   Tips if staying   Get in early to restaurant/cafe and be prepared to wait   Very difficult to find hotel on and industrial estate so plan ahead   If you don't mind staying further  away try Enfield premier inn that's easy to get to and has a proper bar restaurant,Date of stay: December 2014,3.0

Finding this hotel was most frustrating. Having spotted the hotel from the main road actually getting to it was a maze winding through some less than enticing industrial back streets to suddenly come upon this 4 storey new smart building. We unfortunately had problems with room allocation having agreed with them prior to arrival for a room with a low bed to find that it had been given to someone else. Took about 20mins for the reception to come up with a normal room. Unfortunately the room allocated had an adjoining door, which was locked but did not stop very much noise. Having endured disco music and the couple next door arguing about use of facebook we complained to reception at 21.30 who didn't do anything. Gone 22.10 we rang down and complained again and…",Date of stay: December 2014,3.0

Very friendly & helpful staff, meals were nice too, two for one on all drink in the bar (for a limited time). Breakfast was a little late in preparation the only morning I needed to out early!  The rooms & the decor are awesome, revamped & new color scheme, huge bed... and you really dont wanna get out of them!  Although my room was on the side of the North Circular there was no noise whatsoever! definitely worth a stay here!

This time my business partner recommended the Premier Inn. Great choice. Super friendly and attentive staff. Quiet room where I didn't hear any noise from cars.

It is in an awful location over shadowed by industry and factories and is a little difficult to find but once there it is great.  The staff are super friendly and really helpful.   The service is good and rooms immaculate.   The bar and restaurant were good value and the food perfectly good.   Pricing was very fair as well.  £14.50 for a two course meal and a drink is pretty good.  This is fortunate as there is no where else to go in the area.    If you need to stay around this area then its great but obviously not really a holiday spot unless you have an unhealthy interest in incinerator plants.,Date of stay: December 2014,4.0

The deal included breakfast, which again was excellent with plenty of choice and the hot breakfast cooked to order.  The purpose of our stay was to be accessible to family who live a couple of miles away, so we weren't looking for a sightseeing trip and didn't try out local transport links into the city.

The hotel was hard to find, even using my SatNav, but that might have something to do with my dislike of driving in London and my inability to always follow SatNav instructions. However, the hotel was worth it (despite being in an industrial area). Everything was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. The food in the restaurant was really good too. The room we stayed in was well-equipped and just big enough (but in no way was it small or cramped).
